Install

To build the book in PDF format from the sources, you need
the following software pre-installed.

- TeXLive, The book is built with XeLaTeX, a Unicode friendly version of TeX;
- ImageMagick, which can convert the images files to eps format;

Install TeXLive

In Debian/Ubuntu like Linux environment, do **NOT** install the TeXLive through apt-get. Go to TeXLive official site to download the setup scrpt.

$ wget http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/install-tl.zip
$ unzip install-tl.zip
$ cd install-tl
$ sudo ./install-tl -gui text -repository http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet

In Windows, TeXLive provide a gui based installer, in Mac OS X, there's a MacTeX, please visit TeXLive for detail:
https://tug.org/texlive/

Install ImageMagick

$ sudo apt-get install imagemagick

For Windows and Mac OS X installer, it can be download through http://www.imagemagick.org

Cusotmize font (Optional)

If the host system fonts are available, e.g. under VM. they
could be imported as the following example:

$ sudo mkdir /usr/share/fonts/host-system
$ sudo cp /Host-System/Fonts/{FontName, fontname}* /usr/share/fonts/host-system/
$ fc-cache

Others

You need the GNU make tool, in Debian/Ubuntu like Linux, it can be installed through the apt-get command:

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential

In Windows, you can install the MSYS for it. In Mac OS X, please install the developer tool from this command line:

$ xcode-select --install

Build the book PDF

enter the folder contains the book TeX manuscript, run

$ make

This will generate unplugged-en.pdf.
