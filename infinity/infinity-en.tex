Long time ago, our ancestor looked up at the starry sky, facing the vast galaxy, and came up with such a question, how big is the world we live in? As the intelligence being, our mind exceeds ourselves, exceeds our planet and universe. We keep thinking about the concept of infinity. People first abstracted numbers from concrete things. From the three goats hunted, three fruits collected, three jars made, obtained the abstract number three to represents any three things. At the beginning, the numbers were not big, that satisfied everyday life, hunting, and work. As the civilization evolved, people started trading things. People developed varies numbering system to support the bigger and bigger numbers. At some time point, we came up with the question: what is the biggest number? There were two different opinions to it. Some people didn't think the question make sense. It's enough to master numbers like thousands or millions in ancient time in everyday work and life. We needn't trouble ourselves with the big numbers that never being used. It's safe to consider the number of sand-grains in the world is infinity. In ancient Greece, people thought then thousands was a very big number, and named it `murias'. It finally changed to `myriad', means infinity\cite{De-linfini-2018}. In Buddhism, people also said the sand in Ganges River to indicate the numbers that are too large to count. In the Mahayana Buddhist classic work {\em The Diamond Sutra}, it said: ``If a virtuous man or woman filled a number of universes, as great as the number of sand-grains in all these rivers, with the seven treasures, and gave them all away in alms (dana), would his or her merit be great?'' Other people had different opinion. The great ancient Greek mathematician, Archimedes believed, even the sands-grains that filled the whole universe, can be represented with a definite number. In his book, {\em The Sand-Reckoner}, Archimedes said:

\begin{quotation}
\itshape
THERE are some, King Gelon, who think that the number of the sand is infinite in multitude; and I mean by the sand not only that which exists about Syracuse and the rest of Sicily but also that which is found in every region whether inhabited or uninhabited. Again there are some who, without regarding it as infinite, yet think that no number has been named which is great enough to exceed its multitude. And it is clear that they who hold this view, if they imagined a mass made up of sand in other respects as large as the mass of the earth, including in it all the seas and the hollows of the earth filled up to a height equal to that of the highest of the mountains, would be many times further still from recognising that any number could be expressed which exceeded the multitude of the sand so taken. But I will try to show you by means of geometrical proofs, which you will be able to follow, that, of the numbers named by me and given in the work which I sent to Zeuxippus, some exceed not only the number of the mass of sand equal in magnitude to the earth filled up in the way described, but also that of a mass equal in magnitude to the universe.

Archimedes thought it {\em only} need $10^{63}$ sand-grains to fill the universe. The universe he meant was the sphere of the fixed star, which was about twenty thousands times the radius of the earth. We know the observable universe is about 46.5 billion light-years nowadays, consist of around $3 \times 10^{74}$ atoms\footnote{Also said to have $10^{80}$ to $10^{87}$ elementary particles.}. Archimedes was definitely genius in ancient Greek time, he demonstrated how to quantify the `infinite big' things. There are many words in different languages serve as the unit for big numbers. The following table list these words in Chinese, they increase for every $10^4$(\cite{Noguchi2007}, pp31).

The last unit, googol, was coined in 1920 by 9-year-old Milton Sirotta, nephew of U.S. mathematician Edward Kasner. It is written as the digit 1 followed by one hundred zeros. The famous internet company Google's name came from this word\cite{Wikipedia-Googol}.

\section{The infinity concept}
\index{Zeno} \index{Zeno's paradox}

The existence of infinity that beyond all concrete numbers is not only a mathematical question, but also a philosophical question. Infinity also lead to the concept of infinitesimal. The ancient Greek philosopher, Zeno of Elea thought of a set of problems about infinity. Some of them are preserved in Aristotle's {\em Physics}. Among them, four paradoxes are most famous.

 \label{fig:Achilles-paradox}
%\end{wrapfigure}
\end{figure}

The first one is the most popular, named Achilles and the tortoise paradox. Achilles In Greek mythology, Achilles was a hero of the Trojan War, the greatest of all the Greek warriors, and is the central character of Homer's {\em Iliad}. In this paradox, Achilles is in a footrace with the tortoise. Achilles allows the tortoise a head start of 100 meters, for example. Supposing that each racer starts running at some constant speed, one faster than the other. After some finite time, Achilles will have run 100 meters, bringing him to the tortoise's starting point. During this time, the tortoise has run a much shorter distance, say 2 meters. It will then take Achilles some further time to run that distance, by which time the tortoise will have advanced farther; and then more time still to reach this third point, while the tortoise moves ahead. Thus, whenever Achilles arrives somewhere the tortoise has been, he still has some distance to go before he can even reach the tortoise. as shown in figure \ref{fig:Achilles-paradox}. Although it contradicts our common sense in real life, the argument is so convincing. This paradox attracted many great minds for thousands of years. Lewis Carrol, and Douglas Hofstadter even took Achilles and the tortoise as figures in their literary works.

%\end{wrapfigure}
\end{figure}

The second one is called Dichotomy paradox. Atalanta is a character in Greek mythology, a virgin huntress. Suppose Atalanta wishes to walk to the end of a path. Before she can get there, she must get halfway there. Before she can get halfway there, she must get a quarter of the way there. Before traveling a quarter, she must travel one-eighth; before an eighth, one-sixteenth; and so on. This description requires one to complete an infinite number of tasks, which Zeno maintains is an impossibility. The paradoxical conclusion then would be that travel over any finite distance can neither be completed nor begun, and so all motion must be an illusion.

The third one is called Arrow paradox. Zeno states that for motion to occur, an object must change the position which it occupies. He gives an example of an arrow in flight. He states that in any one (duration-less) instant of time, the arrow is neither moving to where it is, nor to where it is not. It cannot move to where it is not, because no time elapses for it to move there; it cannot move to where it is, because it is already there. In other words, at every instant of time there is no motion occurring. If everything is motionless at every instant, and time is entirely composed of instants, then motion is impossible. Whereas the first two paradoxes divide space, this paradox starts by dividing time—and not into segments, but into points.

\end{figure}

The fourth one is called the moving rows paradox, or stadium paradox. It also about dividing time into atomic points. As shown in figure \ref{fig:Moving-rows-paradox}, there are three rows in the stadium. Each row being composed of an equal number of bodies of equal size. At the beginning, they are all aligned. At the smallest time duration, row A stays, row B moves to the right one space unit, while row $\Gamma$ moves to the left one space unit. To row B, row $\Gamma$ actually moves two space units. It means, there should be time duration that $\Gamma$ moves one space unit relative to $B$. And it is the half time of the smallest duration. Since the smallest duration is atomic, it involves the conclusion that half a given time is equal to that time.

\end{figure}

Zeno's paradoxes are easy to understand. However, the conclusion is surprised. In our common sense, motion and time are so real. Achilles must be able to catch up the tortoise. It is hard to solve Zeno's paradox. From Aristotle to Bertrand Russel, from Archimedes to Herman Weyl, all proposed solutions to Zeno's paradoxes\cite{Wikipedia-Zeno}.

Zeno of Elea (about 490BC - 425BC) is ancient Greek philosopher.
He was born in Elea, which was a Greek colony located in present-day southern Italy. Little is known for certain about Zeno's life. In the dialogue of Parmenides, Plato describes a visit to Athens by Zeno and Parmenides, at a time when Parmenides is ``about 65'', Zeno is ``nearly 40'', and Socrates is ``a very young man''. Assuming an age for Socrates of around 20 and taking the date of Socrates' birth as 469 BC gives an approximate date of birth for Zeno of 490 BC. Some less reliable details of Zeno's life are given by Diogenes Laërtius in his {\em Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers}. It said Zeno was the adopted son of Parmenides. He was skilled to argue both sides of any question, the universal critic. And that he was arrested and perhaps killed at the hands of a tyrant of Elea\cite{HanXueTao16}.

Zeno was the primary member of the Eleatics, which were a pre-Socratic school of philosophy founded by Parmenides in the early fifth century BC in the ancient town of Elea. It's another important school after Pythagoras. The Eleatics rejected the epistemological validity of sense experience, and instead took logical standards of clarity and necessity to be the criteria of truth. Of the members, Parmenides and Melissus built arguments starting from sound premises. Zeno, on the other hand, primarily employed the reductio ad absurdum, attempting to destroy the arguments of others by showing that their premises led to contradictions. Zeno is best known for his paradoxes, which Bertrand Russell described as ``immeasurably subtle and profound''.

\end{figure}

Ancient Chinese philosophers developed equivalents to some of Zeno's paradoxes. From the surviving Mohist School of Names book of logic which states, in the archaic ancient Chinese script, ``a one-foot stick, every day take away half of it, in a myriad ages it will not be exhausted.''

Zeno's paradoxes caused deep confusion to the ancient Greeks. The views about time, space, infinity, continuity, and movement are critical to the later philosophers and mathematicians even today. How to understand infinity, became a problem that must be solved by ancient Greek philosophers.

\subsection{Potential infinity and actual infinity}
\index{potential infinity} \index{actual infinity}

Aristotle studied Zeno's paradoxes deeply (most of our understanding to Zeno's paradoxes is through Aristotle's {\em Physics}). One of the most important contributions that Aristotle had made to to study of infinity is identifying a dichotomy between what Aristotle calls the {\em potential infinite} and the {\em actual infinite}. This work fundamentally influenced the later development of mathematics\cite{HanXueTao16}. Potential infinity is a process that never stops. It can be a group of numbers or group of ``things'' that continues without terminating, going on or repeating itself over and over again with no recognizable ending point. The obvious example is the the grouping of natural numbers. No matter where you are while listing or counting out natural numbers, there always exists another number to proceed the one before. Also, in Euclid geometry, a line with a starting point could extend on without end, but could still be potentially infinite because all one would have to do is add on more length to a finite length to allow it to extend\footnote{Euclid avoided to use the term `infinitely extend' in his work. instead he said a line can be extended any long as needed. This is a common treatment in ancient Greece.}. The actual infinite involves  never-ending sets or ``things'' within a space that has a beginning and end; it is a series that is technically ``completed'' but consists of an infinite number of members. According to Aristotle, actual infinities cannot exist because they are paradoxical. It is impossible to say that you can always ``take another step'' or ``add another member'' in a completed set with a beginning and end, unlike a potential infinite. It is ultimately Aristotle’s rejection of the actual infinite that allowed him to refute Zeno’s paradox.

Although Aristotle did disprove the existence of the actual infinite finally, and tended to reject a lot of major concepts in mathematics, the importance of mathematics was still never belittled in Aristotle’s eyes. Aristotle argued that actual infinity as it is not applicable to geometry and the universal, is not relevant to mathematics, making potential infinity all that actually is important.

Aristotle's viewpoint to infinity is typical in ancient Greece. The dichotomy and controversy about potential infinity and actual infinity have been influential till today. Despite of these arguments, the ancient Greek mathematicians achieved amazing result with the potential infinity concept. On success story was that Euclid proved there are infinitely many prime numbers. It is considered the one of most beautiful proofs in history.

\begin{proposition}[Euclid's Elements, Book IX, Proposition 20]
Prime numbers are more than any assigned multitude of prime numbers\cite{Elements}.
\end{proposition}

Euclid intentional avoided using term like `infinitely many' when state this proposition. Such treatment is very common in his Elements. It's famous that Euclid uses reduction to absurdity in his proof. We explain it in modern language.

\begin{proof}
Suppose there are finite prime numbers $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$. Euclid makes a new number:

\[
p_1 p_2 ... p_n + 1
\]

Which is the product of the $n$ prime numbers plus one. It is either prime or not.

\begin{itemize}
\item If it is prime, definitely, it does not equal to any one from $p_1$ to $p_n$, hence it's a new prime not in the list;
\item If it is not prime, then it must have a prime factor $p$. However, no one from $p_1$ to $p_n$ divides this number. It means $p$ is different from any one from $p_1$ to $p_n$, hence it's a new prime beyond those in the list.
\end{itemize}

In both cases, we obtain a new prime number. It contradicts the assumption that there are finite prime numbers. Therefore, there are infinitely many prime numbers.
\end{proof}

From the view point today, Euclid obtained a kind of indirect `proof of existence'. By using proof by contradiction, he proved there are infinitely many prime numbers, but did not give the way to list them. It is quite natural in mathematical proofs now. However, it led to hotly debating about the fundamentals of mathematics in the late 19th and early 20th Century. We'll return to this topic in next chapter.

\index{Aristotle}
Aristotle was a great philosopher and polymath in ancient Greece. Along with his teacher Plato, he has been called the `Father of Western Philosophy'. Little is known about his life. Aristotle was born in the city of Stagira in Northern Greece in 384BC. His father died when Aristotle was a child, and he was brought up by a guardian. At the age of seventeen or eighteen, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there for 20 years until Plato died. This period of study in Plato's Academy deeply influenced Aristotle's life. Socrates was Plato's teacher, and Aristotle was taught by Plato. He soon became an outstanding, and Plato called him ``the Spirit of the Academy''. But Aristotle is not a man who only admires authority without his own opinions. He studied hard, and even established a library for himself.

Shortly after Plato died around 347BC, Aristotle left Athens. The traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the Academy's direction after control passed to Plato's nephew. After that, he traveled around. In 343 BC, Aristotle was invited by Philip II of Macedon to become the tutor to his 13 years old son Alexander. Aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of Macedon. During Aristotle's time in the Macedonian court, he gave lessons not only to Alexander, but also to two other future kings: Ptolemy and Cassander. It was under the influence of Aristotle that Alexander the Great cared about science and respected knowledge.

In 335BC, Philip II died. Aristotle returned to Athens, establishing his own school there known as the Lyceum. Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years. This period in Athens, between 335 and 323 BC, is when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works. He studied and made significant contributions to ``logic, metaphysics, mathematics, physics, biology, botany, ethics, politics, agriculture, medicine, dance and theatre.'' There was legend that Aristotle had a habit of walking while lecturing along the walkways covered with colonnades. It was for this reason that his school was named ``Peripatetic'' (an ancient Greek word, which means ``of walking'' or ``given to walking about''). Aristotle used the language that was much more obscure than Plato's Dialogue. Many of his works are based on lecture notes, and some are even the notes of his students. Aristotle was considered for the first author of textbooks in the West World.

Following Alexander's death, anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens was rekindled. In 322 BC, his enemies reportedly denounced Aristotle for impiety, prompting him to flee to his mother's family estate in Euboea, at which occasion he was said to have stated: ``I will not allow the Athenians to sin twice against philosophy'' – a reference to Athens's trial and execution of Socrates. He died on Euboea of natural causes later that same year, at the age of 63.

More than 2300 years after his death, Aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived. He contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence, and he was the founder of many new fields. Among countless other achievements, Aristotle was the founder of formal logic, pioneered the study of zoology, and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method.

\subsection{Method of exhaustion and calculus}
\index{method of exhaustion}

Some other ancient Greek mathematician took the practical approach about infinity. They developed the method of exhaustion and made surprising achievement.

The idea of method of exhaustion originated in the late 5th Century BC with Antiphon (About 480BC - 410BC). To solve one of the three classic geometric problems, square the circle\footnote{The other two are trisecting the angle, and doubling the cube. Given a circle, ancient Greeks attempted to seek the solution to draw a square that has the same area with only straightedge and compass. Many mathematicians attempted to solve this problem, but all failed until Galois developed theory to prove they were all impossible in 19th Century.}. To approximate the area of a circle, Antiphon started from an inscribed square, then repeatedly double the number of the sides to obtain octagons, hexagons... As the area of the circle gradually ``exhausts'', the side length of inscribed polygons gets smaller and smaller. Antiphon thought the polygon would eventually coincide with the circle. This is the idea of exhaustion. The method was made rigorous a few decades later by Eudoxus of Cnidus, who used it to calculate areas and volumes. The correctness of this method relies on the famous axiom of Eudoxus-Archimedes, also known as axiom of Archimedes.

\index{axiom of Archimedes}
\begin{axiom}
\normalfont
\textbf{Axiom of Archimedes} Given two magnitudes $a$ and $b$, there exists some natural number $n$, such that $a \leq nb$.
\end{axiom}

Axiom of Archimedes is fundamental. We introduced Euclid algorithm to compute the greatest common measurement in chapter 2, however, we did not show if this algorithm always terminates. With axiom of Archimedes, we can prove that Euclid algorithm always terminates. Eudoxus stated ``Given two different magnitudes, for the larger one, subtract a magnitude larger than its half, then for the remaining, subtract another magnitude larger than its half, repeat this process, there must be some remaining less than the smaller one.'' This is logic behind the method of exhaustion.

By using the method of exhaustion, Eudoxus proved that: the volume of a pyramid is one-third the volume of a prism with the same base and altitude, and the volume of a cone is one-third that of the corresponding cylinder. These statements are summarized as propositions in the book 12 of Euclid's {\em Elements}\cite{HanXueTao16}.

Archimedes greatly developed the method of exhaustion, and achieved the highest level, amazing result. He calculated $\pi$, proved the formulas of circular area, surface area and volume of sphere, cone, and even found the method to calculate the area under the parabola curve. He was said to be the god of the mathematics in ancient Greece.

\index{Archimedes}
Archimedes (287BC - 212 BC) was a Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, inventor, and astronomer. He was bore in the seaport city of Syracuse, at that time a self-governing colony in Magna Graecia. During his youth, Archimedes may have studied in Alexandria, Egypt. During his lifetime, Archimedes made his work known through correspondence with the mathematicians in Alexandria. Although few details of his life are known, he is considered the greatest mathematician of antiquity and one of the greatest of all time. various stories about him are widely circulated and popular.

The most widely known anecdote about Archimedes tells of how he uncovered a fraud in the manufacture of a golden crown commissioned by King Hiero II of Syracuse. The king had supplied the pure gold to be used, and Archimedes was asked to determine whether some silver had been substituted by the dishonest goldsmith. Archimedes had to solve the problem without damaging the crown, so he could not melt it down into a regularly shaped body in order to calculate its density. While taking a bath, he noticed that the level of the water in the tub rose as he got in, and realized that this effect could be used to determine the volume of the crown. Archimedes then took to the streets naked, so excited by his discovery that he had forgotten to dress, yelling ``Eureka!'' (Greek word meaning ``I have found [it]!''). The test was conducted successfully, proving that silver had indeed been mixed in. His discovery is the ``Archimedes' Principle'' that every middle school student must learn. Eureka was later used to describe the moment when inspiration was found.

In 214BC, the Second Punic War Broke out. Legend has it that Archimedes created a giant parabolic mirror to deflect the powerful Mediterranean sun onto the ship's sails, setting fire to them. Archimedes also created a huge crane operated hook – the Claw of Archimedes – that was used to lift the enemy ships out of the sea before dropping them to their doom. After two-year-long siege, In 212 BC, the Romans captured Syracuse. The Roman force commander, Marcellus had ordered that Archimedes, the well-known mathematician should not be killed. Archimedes, who was now around 78 years of age, continued his studies after the breach by the Romans and while at home, his work was disturbed by a Roman soldier. The last words attributed to Archimedes are ``Do not disturb my circles!'' The soldier killed Archimedes despite orders that Archimedes should not be harmed. 137 years after his death, the Roman orator Cicero described visiting the tomb of Archimedes. It was surmounted by a sphere and a cylinder, which Archimedes had requested be placed on his tomb to represent his mathematical discoveries\footnote{A sphere has 2/3 the volume and surface area of its circumscribing cylinder including its bases.}.

% Sphere: 4/3 pi r^3, Cylinder: pi r^2 * 2r = 2 pi r^3
% ==> S : C = 4/3 / 2 = 2/3

As an example, let us see how Archimedes calculated $\pi$ with the method of exhaustion around 250BC. Symbol $\pi$ represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, sometimes it's referred to as Archimedes' constant.

As shown in \ref{fig:pi-exhaustion}, Archimedes drew two regular polygons inside and outside a circle of diameter of 1. For a side of the inscribed polygon and the corresponding arc, the length of the arc is greater than the side because the straight line is the shortest between two points. Hence the circumference of the circle is greater than the inscribed polygon. Similarly, circumference of the circle is less than the circumscribed polygon. Since the diameter is 1, the circle's circumference equals $\pi$. Hence the below relation holds:

\[
  C_i < \pi < C_o
\]

Where $C_i$ and $C_o$ are the circumferences of the inscribed and circumscribed polygons respectively. Successively increasing the number of sides approximates the range of $\pi$. Archimedes calculated the 96-sided regular polygon, he proved that $\dfrac{223}{71} < \pi < \dfrac{22}{7}$ (that is $3.1408 < \pi < 3.1429$). This upper bound of $\dfrac{22}{7}$ is widely used in western. The Chinese mathematician Zu Chongzhi, around 480AD, calculated that $3.1415926 < \pi < 3.1415927$ and suggested the approximations $\pi \approx \dfrac{355}{113} = 3.14159292035...$ by applying to a 12,288-sided polygon. This value of remained the most accurate approximation of $\pi$ available for the next 800 years.

The method of exhaustion, developed in ancient Greek time has limitation. Although it's rigorous, it demands specific approach for different problems. As a precursor to the methods of calculus, it's complex. Partly because ancient Greeks rejected irrational numbers, they had to make difference between geometric magnitudes and numbers. Another reason was because they attempted to avoid using infinity and infinitesimal.

Ptolemy, the ancient Greek mathematician, astronomer, and geographer also made great achievement with the method of exhaustion. He developed a geocentric model to calculate the celestial motions. It was almost universally accepted until the scientific revolution. His Planetary Hypotheses presented a physical realization of the universe as a set of nested spheres, in which he used the epicycles of his planetary model to compute the dimensions of the universe. He estimated the Sun was at an average distance of 1,210 Earth radii, while the radius of the sphere of the fixed stars was 20,000 times the radius of the Earth.

After Hellenistic period, the Greek civilization was destroyed by several forces. The Romans conquered Greece, Egypt, and the Near East. In 47BC, the Romans set fire to the Egyptian ships in the harbor of Alexandria; the fire spread and burned the library -- the most expensive ancient libraries. The emperor Theodosius (ruled 379 - 396) proscribed the pagan religions and in 392 ordered that their temples be destroyed, including the temple of Serapis in Alexandria, which housed the only remaining sizable collection of Greek works. Thousands of Greek books were burned by the Romans. Many other works written on parchment were expunged to rewrite Christianity works.

The final blow to the Greek civilization was the conquest of Egypt by the uprising Arab empire in 640. The remaining books were destroyed on the ground that as Omar, the conqueror, put it, ``Either the books contain what we also have, in which case we don't have to read them, or they contain the opposite of what we believe, in which case we must not read them.'' And so for six months the baths of Alexandria were heated by burning rolls of parchment\cite{M-Kline-2007}.

When read the history here, it not only makes people sad and sighs. The tragedy of burning books in South America, in the Qin Empire, has been performed ever since ancient times. After capture of Egypt, the majority of the scholars migrated to Constantinople, which had become the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire. The Arabs absorbed the Greek works, translated and commented extensively to the Greek knowledge. The `House of Wisdom' in Baghdad gradually become the academy enter in the world. After Medieval, Europeans translated the ancient Greek works from Arabic to Latin. Along with the Renaissance in Europe, not only arts and culture, but also mathematics and philosophy recovered and greatly developed.

German astronomer Johannes Kepler took the next important step after Archimedes atop method of exhaustion. When Nicolaus Copernicus began to think astronomy, the Ptolemaic theory had become somewhat more complicated. To explain the variations in speed and direction of the apparent motion of the Moon, Sun, and planets. In particular to explain the apparent retrograde motion of the five planets known at the time, Ptolemy added epicycles, and other complex geometric tricks in his model. In Copernicus' time, the theory required a total of 78 circles to describe the motion of Sun, Moon, and the five planets known then. By moving the Sun to the center, Copernicus was able to reduce the total number of circles (differents and epicycles) to 34. It was greatly simplified from the geocentric model. Kepler made more remarkable achievement. He inherited valuable observation data from the famous astronomer Tycho Brahe. He spent 8 years to analyze the observed data and false trails. Kepler's most famous and important results are known today as Kepler's three law of planetary motion. According to his first law, Kepler broke with the tradition of two thousand years that circle or sphere must be used to describe celestial motions. It states that each planet moves on an ellipse and that the sun is at one (common) focus of each of these elliptical paths. The other radical step Kepler made was he discovered that the planet does not move at a constant velocity. A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time. This is his second law. It explains that why a planet some times moves fast (close to the Sun) while some times moves slowly (far from the Sun). The third law states that, the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. Such complex models required more powerful mathematical tool, the method of exhaustion is not convenient. Kepler then make simplification, and he used the new method on measuring the volume of containers such as wine barrels.

The next important step was made by Descartes and Fermat. Through analytical geometry, numbers and geometry were bridged, and finally evolved to calculus by Issac Newton and Gottfried Whilhelm Leibniz. Infinitesimal is the central concept in calculus, and the integration involved sum of infinite many such quantities. As a side words, John Wallis, the important contributor to calculus, introduced $\infty$ symbol in 1665.

Although the logic foundation of calculus caused hotly debating, this new tool, representing the modern spirit of the West, broke the waves in its sail in the 18th Century. This was an era of heroes. The Bernoulli family, Euler, and Lagrange greatly developed calculus and infinite series, solved many hard problems in astronomy, mechanics, and fluid that people never imagined before.

\section{Potential infinity and programming}
Mathematicians came back to consider actual infinity when debating about how to make calculus rigorous. Before this topic, let us see how the idea of infinity is realized in programming. Computers can only use limited resources. Numbers are represented in binary forms suitable for computer. There are finite many binary bits, hence the numbers represented in computer are also bounded. A binary number of $m$ bits can represent numbers at maximum of $2^m - 1$, which is 11...1 of length $m$. The biggest 16 bits number is $2^{16} - 1 = 65535$. For this reason, if the number of elements in a set is also represented in binary, then the set can only contain finite many elements. In early days of programming, arrays were often used to hold multiple elements. To effectively use computer memories, the size of array need be determined before using. For example below statement in C programming language, declares an array that can hold 10 integers:

\begin{verbatim}
int a[10];
\end{verbatim}

There are two different concepts of numbers, ordinal number and cardinal number. In short, ordinal number is used to describe a way to arrange a collection of objects in order, one after another; while cardinal numbers, are used to measure the size of collections. We'll provide the formal definition later. Both ordinals and cardinals are finite in traditional programming. They can't represent infinity directly. It was reasonable in the early days of computer science. The computer devices were very expensive, people never thought to deal with practice problems with infinity. As time goes, the cost of computation resources keep decreasing. We are not satisfy with the way to predict the size of the collection before using it in programming. New tools, like dynamic array, were developed in some programming environments. They were known as containers, the size can be easily adjusted on-demand. However, even for dynamic containers, the elements are still finite many. It can not exceed the number representation limit. People developed the linked-list, as explained in chapter 1, elements are stored in node, and chained together. The last element points to a special empty node indicating the end. Given such a linked-list, we can start from its head, move to any node in it without need of knowing its cardinal. As far as the storage allows, a linked-list can be arbitrary long. It brings the chance to represent potential infinity.

However, there is eventually a gap between linked-list and potential infinity. We consider natural numbers as potential infinity without terminating or `end point'. But when use linked-list to represent natural numbers, no matter how long the list is, for instance $n$, we have to store all numbers from 0 to $n$ in it. It only represents sequence of 0, 1, ..., $n$, but not the natural numbers, 0, 1, ..., $n$, ...

\index{lazy evaluation}
To model the potential infinity, people introduced concept of lazy evaluation. Instead of evaluate the value of an expression or variable, this evaluation strategy delays it until the value is needed. For the natural number example, any number $n$ has a successor $n+1$ according to Peano's axiom introduced in chapter 1, and the first natural number is 0. Hence we can define natural numbers as below:

\[
N = iterate(n \mapsto n + 1, 0)
\]

Where $iterate$ is defined as:

\[
iterate(f, x) = x : iterate(f, f(x))
\]

Let us see the first several steps when generate natural numbers. To make it simple, denote $succ(n) = n \mapsto n +1$

\[
\begin{array}{rcll}
iterate(succ, 0) & = & 0 : iterate(succ, succ(0)) & \text{definition of } iterate\\
                 & = & 0 : iterate(succ, 1) & succ(0) = 0 + 1 = 1 \\
                 & = & 0 : 1 : iterate(succ, succ(1)) & \\
                 & = & 0 : 1 : iterate(succ, 2) & \\
                 & = & 0 : 1 : 2 : iterate(succ, 3) & \\
                 & = & ... & \\
\end{array}
\]

Without lazy evaluation, this process will repeat endlessly forever. It can not used to solve practical problems. We must change the link operation to lazy evaluation. One method is to leverage the $\lambda$ calculus introduced in chapter 2.

\[
x : xs = cons(x, () \mapsto xs)
\]

We often call the expression $() \mapsto exp$ as $delay(exp)$. It builds a function without argument, when evaluates (the function), gives the result $exp$.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
%\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.4\textwidth}
 \centering
 \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/stream-cons.eps}
 %\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
 \caption{The next node pointed is a $\lambda$ expression. It will create a new node when forced evaluation.}
 \label{fig:stream-cons}
%\end{wrapfigure}
\end{figure}

Therefore, when link $x$ and $xs$ together, the value of $xs$ won't be evaluated, but $xs$ itself will be wrapped in a $\lambda$ expression. And evaluation is delayed to future time. With this modification, the generation of natural numbers changes to:

\[
\begin{array}{rcll}
iterate(succ, 0) & = & 0 : iterate(succ, succ(0)) & \text{definition of } iterate\\
                 & = & cons(0, () \mapsto iterate(succ, succ(0))) & \text{lazy link} \\
\end{array}
\]

The computation stops here. It won't go on. The result is a list. The first element is 0, while the next element is a $\lambda$ expression. If we want to obtain the successive element, we have to force the list evaluation.

\[
next(cons(x, e)) = e()
\]

Whey apply $next$ to $cons(0, () \mapsto iterate(succ, succ(0)))$, we obtain:

\[
\begin{array}{cll}
  & next(cons(0, () \mapsto iterate(succ, succ(0)))) & \\
= & iterate(succ, succ(0)) & \text{definition of } next\\
= & iterate(succ, 1) & \text{definition of } succ\\
= & 1 : iterate(succ, succ(1)) & \text{definition of } iterate\\
= & cons(1, () \mapsto iterate(succ, succ(1))) & \text{lazy link}
\end{array}
\]

The computation stops again. By repeatedly applying $next$ to $N$, we generate natural numbers one by one. People call this kind of model {\em stream}, and use it to represent potential infinity. We can easily define a function to fetch the first $m$ natural numbers from this potential infinite stream.

\[
\begin{array}{l}
take\ 0\ \_\ = [] \\
take\ n\ cons(x, e)\ = cons(x, take(n-1, e())) \\
\end{array}
\]

For example, $take\ 8\ N = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]$. There are examples in the appendix of this chapter about how to define natural numbers with potential infinity in different programming languages.

\subsection{Coalgebra and infinite stream$\bigstar$}

To model the stream of potential infinity, we need the coalgebra concept in category theory introduced in chapter 4. Readers are safe skip this section in the following 2 pages, and directly read from the next section \textbf{Explore the actual infinity}. Let us first revisit coalgebra and F-morphism.

\index{coalgebra}
\begin{definition}
\normalfont
Let $\pmb{C}$ be a category, $\pmb{C} \arrowto{\mathbf{F}} \pmb{C}$ is an endo-functor of category $\pmb{C}$. For the object $A$ and morphism $\alpha$ in this category:

\[
  A \arrowto{\alpha} \mathbf{F} A
\]

Form a pair $(A, \alpha)$. It is called F-coalgebra, where $A$ is the carrier object.
\end{definition}

We can treat F-coalgebra as object. When the context is clear, we denote the object as a pair $(A, \alpha)$. The arrows between such objects are defined as the following:

\begin{definition}
\normalfont
F-morphism is the arrow between F-coalgebra objects:

\[
  (A, \alpha) \longrightarrow (B, \beta)
\]

If the arrow $A \arrowto{f} B$ between the carrier objects make the below diagram commutes:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \matrix (m) [matrix of math nodes,
               row sep=3em, column sep=3em, minimum width=2em]{
    A & \mathbf{F} A \\
    B & \mathbf{F} B \\};
  \path[-stealth]
    (m-1-1) edge node [above] {$\alpha$} (m-1-2)
    (m-1-1) edge node [left] {$f$} (m-2-1)
    (m-1-2) edge node [right] {$\mathbf{F}(f)$}   (m-2-2)
    (m-2-1) edge node [below] {$\beta$} (m-2-2);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Which means $\beta \circ f = \mathbf{F}(f) \circ \alpha$
\end{definition}

F-coalgebra and F-morphism form F-coalgebra category $\pmb{CoAlg}(\mathbf{F})$. For F-algebra, we care about the initial algebra; symmetrically, for F-coalgebra, we care about the {\em final coalgebra}. Where the final coalgebra is the final object in F-coalgebra category, denoted as $(T, \mu)$. For any other algebra $(A, f)$, there exists unique morphism $m$, such that the below diagram commutes:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \matrix (m) [matrix of math nodes,
               row sep=3em, column sep=3em, minimum width=2em]{
    \mathbf{F} T & \mathbf{F} A \\
    T & A \\};
  \path[-stealth]
    (m-1-2) edge node [above] {$\mathbf{F}(m)$} (m-1-1)
    (m-2-1) edge node [left] {$\mu$} (m-1-1)
    (m-2-2) edge node [right] {$f$} (m-1-2)
    (m-2-2) edge node [below] {$m$} (m-2-1);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

From Lambek theorem, the final coalgebra is the fixed point for functor. The morphism $T \arrowto{\mu} \mathbf{F} T$ is an isomorphism, such that $\mathbf{F} T$ is isomorphic to $T$. The final coalgebra can be used to build infinite data structures.

\index{anamorphism}
We use catamorphism to evaluate the initial algebra. Symmetrically, we use anamorphism (prefix ana- means upward) to coevaluate the final coalgebra. For any coalgebra $(A, f)$, the unique arrow to the final coalgebra $(T, \mu)$ can represented with the anamorphism as $\llb f \rlb$. The brackets do not look like bananas any more, but like a pair of lenses in optics. They are known as \textbf{lens brackets}. As shown in below diagram:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \matrix (m) [matrix of math nodes,
               row sep=3em, column sep=3em, minimum width=2em]{
    T  & \mathbf{F} T \\
    A  & \mathbf{F} A \\};
  \path[-stealth]
    (m-1-1) edge node [above] {$\mu$} (m-1-2)
    (m-2-1) edge node [left] {$\llb f \rlb$} (m-1-1)
    (m-2-2) edge node [right] {$\mathbf{F}\ \llb f \rlb$}  (m-1-2)
    (m-2-1) edge node [below] {$f$} (m-2-2);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\[
  m = \llb f \rlb \text{，if and only if} \mu \circ m = \mathbf{F}(m) \circ f
\]

Let us see how anamorphism builds infinite stream. Anamorphism takes a coalgebra $A \arrowto{f} \mathbf{F} A$ and a carrier object $A$, it generates the fixed point of functor $\mathbf{F}$, which is $\mathbf{Fix}\ \mathbf{F}$. This fixed point is the final coalgebra. It has the form of infinite stream.

\[
\llb f \rlb = \mathbf{Fix} \circ \mathbf{F}\ \llb f \rlb \circ f
\]

We can also define the anamorphism as the function that returns the fixed point:

\[
\begin{array}{l}
(A \to \mathbf{F} A) \arrowto{ana} (A \to \mathbf{Fix}\ \mathbf{F}) \\
ana\ f = Fix \circ fmap\ (ana\ f) \circ f \\
\end{array}
\]

As a concrete example, functor $\mathbf{F}$ is defined as:

\begin{lstlisting}
data StreamF E A = StreamF E A
\end{lstlisting}

Its fixed point is:

\begin{lstlisting}
data Stream E = Stream E (Stream E)
\end{lstlisting}

$\mathbf{StreamF}\ E$ is a normal functor, we intend to give it name of `stream'. The coalgebra of this functor is such a function, it transforms a `seed' $a$ of type $A$ to a pair, containing $a$, and the next seed.

Coalgebra can generates varies of infinite streams. Here are two examples. The first example is Fibonacci numbers. We use $(0, 1)$ as the starting seed. To generate the next seed, we take the second value 1 in the pair as the first value in the new pair, and use $0 + 1$ as the second value in the new pair to form the new seed $(1, 0 + 1)$. Repeat this process, for seed $(m, n)$, we generate the next seed $(n, m + n)$. Written in coalgebra, we have the following definition:

\[
\begin{array}{l}
(Int, Int) \arrowto{fib} \mathbf{StreamF}\ Int\ (Int, Int) \\
fib (m, n) = \mathbf{StreamF}\ m\ (n, m + n)
\end{array}
\]

In this definition, the carrier object $A$ is a pair of integers. With coalgebra, we can feed it into anamorphism to build the infinite stream of Fibonacci numbers. For functor $\mathbf{StreamF}\ E$, the type of the anamorphism is:

\[
(A \to \mathbf{StreamF}\ E\ A) \arrowto{ana} (A \to \mathbf{Stream}\ E)
\]

We can realize it as:

\[
\begin{array}{l}
ana\ f = fix \circ f \\
\text{where: } fix\ (StreamF\ e\ a) = Stream\ e\ (ana\ f\ a)
\end{array}
\]

Apply the anamorphism to coalgebra $fib$ and the start pair $(0, 1)$ gives infinite stream that generates Fibonacci numbers:

\[
ana\ fib\ (0, 1)
\]

We can define a auxiliary function to take the first $n$ elements from the infinite stream:

\begin{lstlisting}
take 0 _ = []
take n (Stream e s) = e : take (n - 1) s
\end{lstlisting}

The next example demonstrates how to generate infinite stream of prime numbers with the sieve of Eratosthenes method. The start seed is `all' the natural numbers with 1 being removed: 2, 3, 4, ... From this seed, we remove all the multiples of 2 to obtain the next seed, which is a infinite list start from 3 as 3, 5, 7, ... Next, we remove all the multiples of 3, and repeated this process. This method is defined as below coalgebra:

\[
\begin{array}{l}
[Int] \arrowto{era} \mathbf{StreamF}\ Int\ [Int] \\
era (p:ns) = \mathbf{StreamF}\ p\ \{ n\ |\ p \nmid n, n \in ns\} \\
\end{array}
\]

Then feed it to anamorphism, we obtain the infinite stream that generate all prime numbers:

\begin{lstlisting}
primes = ana era [2...]
\end{lstlisting}

For list particularly, anamorphism is called unfold. Anamorphism and catamorphism are mutually inverse. We can turn the infinite stream back to list through catamorphism.

\section{Explore the actual infinity}

Aristotle's influence was profound. For more than two thousand years, mathematicians and philosophers had been thinking about concept of infinity. Most of them accepted the potential infinity. However, there were discordant views about actual infinity. For a long time, people believed the actual infinity was God, or only God mastered actual infinity. Many attempts to reasoning the actual infinity led to confusion and contradict result. For example, let all the natural numbers be actual infinity. Because from the beginning, natural numbers are separated by even numbers and odd numbers. They alternate in turns. It's natural to think that all even numbers are half of all natural numbers. However, doubling every natural number gives an even number; and dividing every even number by 2 gives a natural number vise versa. Then there is one to one correspondence between all the natural numbers and even numbers. Are these two actual infinities same? If not, which one has more? natural numbers or even numbers?

\index{Galileo's paradox}
Father of the modern science, Galileo Galilei made a similar paradox in his final scientific work {\em Two New Sciences} in 1636. First, some numbers are squares, while others are not; therefore, all the numbers, including both squares and non-squares, must be more numerous than just the squares. And yet, for every number there is exactly one square. Forms the sequence 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ... hence, there cannot be more of one than of the other. This paradox is known as Galileo's paradox.

Not only for numbers, people found similar paradox in Geometry. As shown in figure \ref{fig:circles-paradox}, For two circles with the same center, every radius connects two points in each circle respectively, hence, there is one to one correspondence between the points in the bigger circle and the smaller circle. It indicates there are same many points in each circle. However, our common sense tells there must be more points in the bigger one.

 \caption{Every point in the big circle is corresponding to a point in the small circle.}
 \label{fig:circles-paradox}
%\end{wrapfigure}
\end{figure}

Because of these paradoxes, people accepted Aristotle's approach to avoid using actual infinity. Galileo concluded that the ideas of less, equal, and greater couldn't apply to infinite sets like natural numbers. People rejected terms of actual infinity, like ``all the natural numbers''.

\end{wrapfigure}
%\end{figure}

About two hundred years after Galileo, German mathematician Cantor led people broke into the Kingdom of infinity. From these paradoxes, Cantor thought the key problem lay in our common sense assumption, that the whole must be larger than the part. Is it necessarily right? The development of modern science taught us our common view to things could be incomplete or wrong. The theory of relativity challenges our understanding to space and time -- the space we are living in is not necessarily the Euclidean space; Quantum mechanics challenges our common sense that the world is causal -- randomness rules the quantum world. When think out of the box, it will open up a new world we've never seen, resulting in fundamental development. This was exactly what Cantor did. If we accept the counter-intuitive result, that `the part can equal to the whole', then the door to the infinity is open. He established the importance of one-to-one correspondence between the members of two sets, and defined (actual) infinite sets.

To compare two sets, Cantor defined if there is one to one correspondence between them, that every element in set $M$ has the unique corresponding element in set $N$, then the two sets are equinumerous. That is of the same size or having the same number of elements\footnote{Remind the `isomorphic' concept we introduced in chapter 3.}. For finite sets, it is true obviously, when extends to infinite sets, it means there are same infinite many even numbers as the natural numbers! there are same infinite many square numbers as natural numbers, the points in smaller circle and the bigger circle of the same center are equinumerous... Cantor's friend, Richard Dedekind even gave such a definition\footnote{known as Dedekind infinite set nowadays.} of infinite set in 1888: if some proper subset of a set is equinumerous to this set, then it is a infinite set.

% Cardinality vs. cardinal number

\subsection{Paradise of infinite kingdom}

Let us have a glance view of the garden in infinite kingdom. David Hilbert told an interesting story in a lecture in 1924 (published in 2013) to help people understanding Cantor's infinite sets. It was popularized through George Gamow's 1947 book {\em One Two Three... Infinity}.

In this story, there is a Grand hotel with infinite many rooms. It is fully occupied during the hot season. In the evening, a tired driver has passed many ``No vacany'' hotels before reaching to this one. He goes to see if there might nonetheless be a room for him. The clerk, Hilbert said: ``No problem, we can make a room for you.'' He asked the guest in room 1 to move to room 2, then moved the guest in room 2 to room 3, and moved the guest in room 3 to room 4, ... He moved every one from current room to the next room. That freed up the first room for this new guest.

The story goes on. On the second day, there comes a tour group of infinite many guests. Hilbert said: ``No problem, we can make rooms for every one.'' He asked the new guest who was in room 1 last night to move to room 2, then moved the guest in room 2 to room 4, and moved the guest in room 3 to room 6, ... He moved every one in room $i$ to room $2i$. Since the hotel has infinite many rooms, after moving, room 2, 4, 6, ... these even number rooms are occupied with the guests accommodated yesterday, while the room 1, 3, 5, ... these odd number rooms are free up. There are infinite many odd numbers rooms that can accommodate every member in the tour group.

The story does not end. On the third day, there comes infinite many tour groups of infinite many guests each. Can the magic Hilbert's hotel accommodate them all? Before see the answer, let us first revisit the story on the first two days.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

 \label{fig:Hilbert-hotel-1}
%\end{wrapfigure}
\end{figure}

As shown in figure \ref{fig:Hilbert-hotel-1}, on the first day, we move every guest to the next room to free up room 1. Essentially, we establish a 1-to-1 correspondence for shadowed circles between the two rows as $n \leftrightarrow n+1$. It reveals a counterintuitive fact that infinity plus one is infinity again. Hilbert's grand hotel can accommodate not only this one more guest, but also finite many $k$ new guests by repeating this arrangement $k$ times. It means:

\bean
\infty + 1 = \infty \\
\infty + k = \infty \\
\eean

\begin{figure}[htbp]

 %\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
 \caption{Second day of Hilbert's Grand hotel}
 \label{fig:Hilbert-hotel-2}
%\end{wrapfigure}
\end{figure}

The solution for the second day is shown in figure \ref{fig:Hilbert-hotel-2}. We essentially establish a 1-to-1 correspondence between natural numbers and even numbers, hence free up infinite many odd number rooms. Then we establish another 1-to-1 correspondence between these empty rooms and the infinite many guests in the tour group, which is exactly the 1-to-1 correspondence between odd numbers and natural numbers. The second day story tells us, infinity plus infinity is infinity again.

\[
\infty + \infty = \infty
\]

It's natural to ask, although the symbols are same, does the infinity on the left hand equal to the infinity on the right hand? Can we compare between infinities for size? We'll see later, it was exactly this question, led Cantor to study infinity in depth. In Hilbert's Grand hotel story, we can establish 1-to-1 correspondence between all these infinities, hence they are all equinumerous. Such infinity that has 1-to-1 correspondence with natural numbers are called `countable infinity'.

To solve the problem on the third day of Hilbert's Grand hotel, we need think about how to establish the 1-to-1 correspondence between the infinite many tour groups of infinity many guests and the infinity many rooms. One may come to the idea to arrange the guests in the first tour group to room 1, 2, 3, ... then arrange the guests in the second group to room $\infty + 1$, $\infty + 2$, ... However, this method does not work. We don't know which one are more numerous, the rooms or the guests before the arrangement. Consider how this process executes. The first guest in the second group will never know when the first group finishes accommodating, this guest has no way to determine which room should move to. Compare with the first day story, the new guest could immediately move to room 1 when the original guest moved to room 2, although the whole infinity accommodating process is endless. Same situation happened on the second day. When the original guest in room 1 moved to room 2, the first guest in the tour group could move to the freed up room 1 immediately. Next the original guest in room 2 moved to room 4, and the guest in room 3 moved to room 6, at this time, the second guest in the tour group could move to room 3...

Figure \ref{fig:NNtoN} gives a numbering solution. For convenient purpose, we label the first guest 0, the second guest 1, the third guest 2, ... We label the guests already lived in the hotel as group 0, the first tour group 1, the second group 2, ... In this figure, every guest corresponds to a grid point. We also count the hotel rooms from 0.

Now we arrange rooms in this order: assign the guest 0 in group 0 to room 0, the guest 1 in group 0 to room 1, the guest 0 in group 1 to room 2, the guest 0 in group 2 to room 3, the guest 1 in group 1 to room 4, ... Along the zig-zag path, we can assign room one by one, without missing any guests. Hence we establish a 1-to-1 correspondence between every guest in these infinite many groups and the infinity many rooms. Hilbert's Grand hotel surprisingly holds `two-dimensional' infinity\footnote{The traditional solution uses the Euclid's theorem, that there are infinite many prime numbers. Empty the odd numbered rooms by sending the guest in room $i$ to room $2^{i}$, then put the first group's guests in rooms $3^{n}$, the second group's guests in rooms $5^{n}$, ... put the $k$-th group's guests in rooms $p^n$, where $p$ is the $k$-th prime number. This solution leaves certain rooms empty, specifically, all odd numbers that are not prime powers, such as 15 or 847, will no longer be occupied.}.

\subsection{One-to-one correspondence and infinite set}

From Hilbert's Grand hotel story, we see the importance of the 1-to-1 correspondence when study infinity. If there exists 1-to-1 correspondence between two sets, then they have the same cardinality. We can further use 1-to-1 correspondence to classify sets. As explained in chapter 3, for two sets $A$ and $B$, we establish a map $A \arrowto{f} B$, such that every element $x$ in $A$ is corresponding to an element $y$ in $B$ through $x \mapsto y = f(x)$. For sets, we call $f$ function. $y$ is the image of $x$, and $x$ is preimage. If there is exactly one preimage, such map is called {\em injective function}; if every element $y$ in $B$ has a preimage, then the map is called {\em surjective} or onto. If a map is both injective and surjective, it is called bijective or one-to-one correspondence. Figure \ref{fig:bijection} illustrates a bijection between two sets.

\end{figure}

Hilbert's Grand hotel gives surprisingly counterintuitive properties of infinity. The set of natural numbers is equinumerous with its proper subsets like even and odd numbers. And the one dimensional natural number $n$ and two dimensional pair $(m, n)$ are also equinumerous. Starting from natural numbers, Cantor expanded a series of infinite sets through 1-to-1 correspondence. for example:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Integers}. We can establish the following 1-to-1 correspondence:

\begin{tabular}{ccccccccc}
0 & 1 & -1 & 2 & -2 & ... & $n$ & $-n$ & ... \\
$\updownarrow$ & $\updownarrow$ & $\updownarrow$ & $\updownarrow$ & $\updownarrow$ & & $\updownarrow$ & $\updownarrow$ & \\
0 & 1 &  2 & 3 &  4 & ... & $2n - 1$ & $2n$ & ... \\
\end{tabular}

Hence to expand natural numbers to integers. From another view point, we essentially correspond odd numbers to positive integers, and correspond even numbers to negative integers and zero. It tells that the integers and natural numbers are equinumerous.

\item \textbf{Rationals}. A rational number can be expressed as the quotient or fraction $p/q$ of two integers, a numerator $p$ and a non-zero denominator $q$. On the third day of Hilbert's Grand hotel story, we established 1-to-1 correspondence between a pair $(p, q)$ and a natural number. We can adjust it a bit for rational number $p/q$. Put negative numbers aside for now, we skip whenever the second number $q$ is zero, or $p/q$ is irreducible fraction (no common divisor). Then we re-use the method for integers, to cover the negative rational numbers as well. In this way, we construct rational numbers from natural numbers. Below table illustrates how the first several natural numbers correspond to rational numbers:

\begin{tabular}{cccccccccc}
0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & ... \\
$\updownarrow$ & $\updownarrow$ & $\updownarrow$ & $\updownarrow$ & $\updownarrow$ & $\updownarrow$ & $\updownarrow$ & $\updownarrow$ & $\updownarrow$ & \\
0 & 1 & $\dfrac{1}{2}$ & $-\dfrac{1}{2}$ & -1 & -2 & $-\dfrac{2}{3}$ & $-\dfrac{1}{3}$ & $\dfrac{1}{3}$ & ... \\
\end{tabular}

It tells us natural numbers and rational numbers are equinumerous.

\index{algebraic numbers}
\item \textbf{Algebraic numbers}. An algebraic number is a root of a non-zero polynomial in one variable with rational coefficients. Equivalently, by clearing denominators, we can loose the coefficients to integers. For example, $\sqrt{2}$ and $1 \pm \sqrt{3}i$ are algebraic numbers, while $\pi$ and $e$ are not.

Given an algebraic equation

\[
a_0 x^n + a_1 x^{n-1} + ... + a_n = 0
\]

Where $a_0, a_1, ... a_n$ are integers, and $a_0 \neq 0$. All its rots are algebraic numbers. Define a positive integer:

\[
h = n + |a_0| + |a_1| + ... + |a_n|
\]

Which is the sum of the degree and coefficients of the equation. We name it as the height $h$ of the equation. For any algebraic equation, $h$ is a unique natural number. On the other hand, given a height $h$, there could be multiple equations. For example, the height of equations $x - 3 = 0$, $x^3 + 1 = 0$, $x^3 - 1 = 0$, $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$, $x^2 - x + 1 = 0$ are all 4. However, there are finite many equations for a every $h$. Therefore, we can enumerate all algebraic equations: first list all equations of height $h=1$, then list the equations of height $h=2$, ... and repeated this process. The equations of the same heights can be list in arbitrary order. According to the fundamental theorem of algebra proved by Gauss, the number of roots equals to the equation degree $n$. Taking the multiplicity into consideration, the number of different roots is not greater than $n$. Hence there are finite many roots for equation of height $h$. Now we can enumerate all algebraic numbers.

First, we enumerate all roots for equations of height $h=1$ (only one such equation $x = 0$), which is 0; then enumerate all roots for equations of height 2. Because different equations may have some same root, we need skip any root if it was enumerated before. In this way, we establish the 1-to-1 correspondence between algebraic numbers and natural numbers. Hence they are equinumerous. In other words, we can extend to all algebraic numbers from natural numbers.
\end{enumerate}

We'll meet a problem next. Can we extend natural numbers to real numbers? not only for normal irrationals, but also cover transcendental numbers like $\pi$ and $e$? Cantor and Dedekind made great breakthrough when study this problem.

\index{Cantor}
Georg Cantor was a German mathematician, He created set theory, which has became a fundamental theory in mathematics. Cantor was born in 1845 in the western merchant colony of Saint Petersburg, Russia, and brought up in the city until he was eleven. His father was a successful merchant, and member of the Saint Petersburg stock exchange; his mother came from a family well-known of music. When his father became ill, the family moved to Germany Frankfurt in 1856. Cantor demonstrated exceptional skill in mathematics in school. But his father wanted Cantor to became ``a shining star in the engineering firmament.'' However, at the age of 17, Cantor had sought his father's permission to study mathematics at university and he was overjoyed when eventually his father consented\cite{HanXueTao16}.

He entered the Polytechnic of Zürich in 1862, then moved to the University of Berlin in 1863. He attended lectures by Leopold Kronecker, Karl Weierstrass and Ernst Kummer. He spent the summer of 1866 at the University of Göttingen. Cantor was a good student, and he received his doctorate degree in 1867 with the dissertation on number theory. Cantor later took up a position at the University of Halle, where he spent his entire career.

At that time, many mathematicians were trying to rebuild the rigorous logical foundation of analysis led by Weierstrass. Cantor also influenced by this movement. He soon realized the importance to study real numbers as the basis of calculus, which became the beginning of set theory research.

In 1872, he met and began a friendship with the young mathematician Richard Dedekind while on holiday in Switzerland. Even in Cantor's honeymoon in Harz mountains, Cantor spent much time in mathematical discussions with Dedekind. They started a long time correspondence between each other.

In 1874, Cantor published his first revolutionary paper about set theory at the age of 29. It marked as the beginning of set theory as a branch of mathematics.
1874年29岁的康托尔发表了关于集合论的第一篇革命性论文。康托尔开始显示他非凡的独创力。在随后的十几年中，他几乎独自一人把集合论推向深入，引领了数学中无穷的革命。在他最伟大的、最具创见的时期，康托尔却没有能得到应有的认可。他没能取得柏林大学的教授职位。他的大部分研究时光是在哈雷大学度过的。这是一所不大出名、薪金微薄的二流学院。他的成果在当时很难被理解。由于太过颠覆传统，加之无穷集合引发了一些悖论（我们将在下一章详细介绍罗素悖论），人们对集合论的基础和可靠性产生了严重的怀疑。康托尔遭到了许多人的反对，其中反对最激烈的是他的老师，柏林学派的代表人物克罗内克。克罗内克有一句名言：“上帝创造了自然数，其余都是人的工作。”他批判康托尔的无穷集合和超限数理论不是数学而是神秘主义，是一类危险的数学疯狂。他认为数学在康托尔的领导下正在走向疯人院。除了克罗内克之外，还有一些著名的数学家也对集合论发表了反对意见，包括法国著名数学家——被称为最后一个数学通才的庞加莱，他说：“我个人，而且还不只我一个人，认为重点在于，切勿引进一些不能用有限个文字去完全定义好的东西。”他把集合论当作一个有趣的“病理学的情形”来谈，并且预测说：“后一代将把集合论当作一种疾病，而人们已经从中恢复过来了”。德国数学家赫尔曼$\cdot$外尔认为，康托尔关于基数的等级观点是“雾上之雾”。克莱因也不赞成集合论的思想。施瓦兹原来是康托尔的好友，但他由于反对集合论而同康托尔断交。集合论的悖论出现之后，一些数学家开始认为集合论根本是一种病态，他们以不同的方式发展为经验主义、直觉主义、构造主义等学派，在数学的基础大战中，构成反康托尔的阵营。

于是悲剧的结局不是集合论进入了疯人院，而是康托尔进入了疯人院。1884年5月，他支持不住了，第一次精神崩溃。在他一生的随后岁月中，这种崩溃以不同强度反复发生，把他从社会上赶进精神病院这个避难所。1904年在两个女儿的陪同下，他出席了第三届国际数学家大会。会上他的精神受到严重刺激，立即被送进医院。在他生命的最后十年，他大都处于严重的抑郁状态中，并在哈雷大学的精神病诊所度过了漫长的岁月。他最后一次住进精神病院是1917年5月，直至1918年1月去世。

康托尔的集合论得到公开的承认和热情的称赞应该说首先在瑞士苏黎世召开的第一届国际数学家大会上表现出来。瑞士苏黎世理工大学教授胡尔维茨（Hurwitz，Adolf，1859－1919）在他的综合报告中，明确地阐述康托尔集合论对函数论的进展所起的巨大推动作用，这破天荒第一次向国际数学界显示康托尔的集合论不是可有可无的哲学，而是真正对数学发展起作用的理论工具。在分组会上，法国数学家阿达玛也报告康托尔对他的工作的重要作用。随着时间的推移，人们逐渐认识到集合论的重要性。希尔伯特高度赞誉康托尔的集合论“是数学天才最优秀的作品”，“是人类纯粹智力活动的最高成就之一”，“是这个时代所能夸耀的最巨大的工作”。在1900年第二届国际数学家大会上，希尔伯特高度评价了康托尔工作的重要性，并把康托尔的连续统假设列入20世纪初有待解决的23个重要数学问题之首。当康托尔的朴素集合论出现一系列悖论时，直觉主义学派的代表布劳威尔等人借此再次发难，希尔伯特用坚定的语言向他的同代人宣布：“没有任何人能将我们从康托尔所创造的伊甸园中驱赶出来”。

%\end{figure}

\index{戴徳金}
戴徳金是德国数学家、教育家。1831年10月6日生于德国的不伦瑞克镇的一个知识分子家庭。这里也是著名数学家高斯的故乡。戴徳金的父亲为法学教授，母亲也是一位教授的女儿。1850年戴徳金到哥廷根大学师从著名的数学大师高斯研究最小二乘法和高等测量，向斯特恩学习数论基础，向韦伯学习物理，他还选修过天文学。1852年他在高斯的指导下获得博士学位，博士论文是《关于欧拉积分的理论》。在哥廷根求学期间，他还结识了黎曼、狄利克雷。在于这些世界级的数学家交流中，他获益匪浅，并逐渐萌生了用算术性质来重新定义无理数的想法。1854年戴徳金留校任代课教师。如第三章所说，他很早就在教学中讲授伽罗瓦理论并引入了域的概念。

戴徳金为人谦逊。他的许多成果并不为当时的人所知。例如在狄利克雷去世之后，戴徳金根据当时听讲的笔记整理出了《数论讲义》这一名著。尽管戴徳金在后继版本中添加了很多结论，但他却谦逊地将这本书记在了狄利克雷名下。令人遗憾的是，这种做法对其职业生涯造成了影响。他没有能获得哥廷根大学的终身教席，而是去了一家比较小的技术大学（\cite{Stepanov}第119页）——在他家乡不伦瑞克的高等工业学院。

事物总是两面性的，在不伦瑞克，戴徳金感觉自己有从事数学研究的充分时间与足够的自由。1888年，戴德金提出了算术公理的完整系统，其中包括完全数学归纳法原理的准确表达方式。戴德金的主要成就是在代数理论方面。他研究过任意域、环、群、结构及模等问题，并在授课时率先引入了环（域）的概念，并给理想子环下了一般定义，提出了能和自己的真子集建立一对应的集合是无穷集的思想。在研究理想子环理论过程中，他将序集（置换群）的概念用抽象群的概念来取代，并且用一种比较普通的公式（戴德金分割概念）表示出来，直接影响了后来皮亚诺的自然数公理的诞生。是最早对实数理论提出了许多论据的数学家之一。现今数学上的许多命题和术语，如群、环、域、结构、模、理想、函数、定理等，都是与他的名字联系在一起的。

戴徳金于1916年2月12日去世。说到他的去世，有一则趣闻。有一天，戴徳金发现托博纳写的《数学家传记》中，赫然写到：1897年9月4日戴徳金去世。出于纠正这个错误的想法，他给传记的编辑写去了一封信：“根据我本人的日记，我在这一天非常健康，而且与我的午餐客人，尊敬的朋友康托尔一起谈论着一些趣事，过得非常愉快。”\cite{HanXueTao16}

即使在当代，数学界对于康托尔和戴徳金学派的观点仍存在分歧。迪厄多内在1980年代仍然认为戴徳金的工作引起了不必要的混乱。更不用说二十世纪之初的激烈分歧和争执了。我们今天看到的大多数传记和评论往往过于批判责备克罗内克、布劳威尔及其代表的直觉主义，而同情康托尔的不幸遭遇，并热情赞颂无穷集合和超限数的革命性创造。作为今天理性的读者，我们建议大家独立思考，而不要被一边倒的观点左右。克罗内克和康托尔都是虔诚的宗教信徒，克罗内克对数学哲学有着强烈的信念，试图将一切数学(从代数学到分析)算术化是他的最高愿望。他写道：“有一天人们将成功地将所有数学算术化，就是说将数学建立在最狭义的数概念的单一基础上。”他相信人们在各种数学分支中能够也必须以这种方式限定一个定义，即人们可用有限步验证它是否适用于任意已知量。同样，一个量的存在性证明只有当它包含一种方法，通过它可以实际地发现要证明存在的量时，才可被认为是完全严格的。这些正是后来重要的数学哲学流派——直觉主义学派所坚持的信念。因此，克罗内克被认为是直觉主义学派的先驱。他的这些原则也正是现代数学的重要领域——构造性数学研究的起点。他的怀疑精神对人们重新批判地检查数学的基础起了鼓舞作用。它导致了数学中两种有建设性的批判运动：有限步构造性证明与存在性证明，以及从数学中驱除不能以有限个词明确表述的定义。这些有利于人们更清楚地认识数学的本质。庞加莱的观点也是值得我们深入思考的。他在《科学与假设》这本书中阐述了他的哲学思想。他认为公理是一种约定。在思考物理学的基本定义，如力的定义时他说，如果一个定义不能让我们去测量它，这个定义就没有任何用处。庞加莱的思想直接影响了爱因斯坦和相对论。

\subsubsection{利用（可数）无穷定义斐波那契数列和哈明数列}

有些编程环境，所有的求值默认都是惰性的，在这样的环境中，我们甚至可以直接拿潜无穷流进行复杂的计算。例如下面是另一种自然数的定义方法：

\[
N = 0 : map(succ, N)
\]

它的含义是，$N$是一个潜无穷，代表自然数。第一个自然数是0，从第二个自然数开始，后面每个自然数，都等于前一个自然数的后继。如同下面的表格：

\begin{tabular}{|r|r|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
                 & $N$: & 0 & 1 & 2 & ... \\
\hline
                 & $map(succ, N)$: & $succ(0)$ & $succ(1)$ & $succ(2)$ & ... \\
\hline
$0 : map(succ, N)$: & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & ... \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

例如下面的代码先定义了自然数的潜无穷，然后取出其中的前10个自然数：

\lstset{frame=single}
\begin{lstlisting}
nat = 0 : map (+1) nat

take 10 nat
[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
\end{lstlisting}

类似地，我们也可以用潜无穷定义斐波那契数列。假设$F$是全体斐波那契数列，我们知道它的第一个元素是0，第二个是1，后面每个斐波那契数都是前面两个的和。我们可以仿照自然数的例子列出下面的表格：

\begin{tabular}{|r|r|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
  & $F$:  & 0 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 5 & 8 & ... \\
\hline
  & $F'$: & 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 5 & 8 & 13 & ... \\
\hline
0 & 1     & 1 & 2 & 3 & 5 & 8 & 13 & 21 & ... \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

其中第一行为全体斐波那契数。第二行为去掉一个元素后的全体斐波那契数。也可以这样想：把第一行向左移动一格就得到了第二行。第三行最有趣，把前两行每列加起来，我们就又得到了全体斐波那契数，只不过缺了最开始的两个数0和1。所以把它们两个补在第三行的最左边。把第三行翻译过来就是斐波那契数的潜无穷流定义：

\[
F = \{0, 1\} \cup \{ x + y | x \in F, y \in F'\}
\]

或者写成代码：
\begin{lstlisting}
fib = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fib (tail fib)
\end{lstlisting}

\index{正规数} \index{哈明数}
我们再给出一个稍微复杂些的例子，数学上把只含有2、3、5这三个因子组成的自然数叫作正规数。在计算机科学中，也常常叫作哈明数以纪念美国数学家，图灵奖获得者理查德$\cdot$哈明(1915-1998)。前几个哈明数如下：

\[
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 20, 24, 25, 27, 30, 32, 36, 40, 45, 48, 50, 54, 60, ...
\]

写一个计算机程序来产生哈明数并不简单，然而利用无穷流，我们可以得到一个直观高效的解法。假设全体哈明数的潜无穷流为$H$。我们知道第一个哈明数是1，后面的哈明数可以这样构造，我们把$H$中的每个数都乘以2，仍然是哈明数，记作$H_2 = \{ 2x | x \in H \}$，类似地我们可以定义$H_3 = \{ 3x | x \in H \}$和$H_5 = \{ 5x | x \in H \}$，如果把这三个新序列中的数，从小到大合并起来，去掉重复的，并且在前面补充上1，就又得到了全体哈明数。

\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
H & = & \{ 1 \} \cup H_2 \cup H_3 \cup H_5 \\
  & = & \{ 1 \} \cup \{ 2x | x \in H \} \cup \{ 3x | x \in H \} \cup \{ 5x | x \in H \} \\
\end{array}
\]

其中$\cup$的含义就是从小到大，去掉重复、合并两个无穷序列$X = \{x_1, x_2, ...\}$和$Y = \{y_1, y_2, ...\}$：

\[
X \cup Y =
\begin{cases}
x_1 < y_1 : & \{x_1, X' \cup Y \} \\
x_1 = y_1 : & \{x_1, X' \cup Y' \} \\
x_1 > y_1 : & \{y_1, X \cup Y' \} \\
\end{cases}
\]

写成代码就是：

\begin{lstlisting}
ham = 1 : map (*2) ham # map (*3) ham \# map (*5) ham
  where xxs@(x:xs) # yys@(y:ys)
    | x==y = x : xs # ys
    | x<y  = x : xs # yys
    | x>y  = y : xxs # ys

ham !! 1000000
519312780448388736089589843750000000000000000000000000
000000000000000000000000000000
\end{lstlisting}

\lstset{frame=none}

\subsection{可数无穷与不可数无穷}
\index{可数集}
迄今为止，我们用自然数构造了整数、有理数、和包含部分无理数的代数数。它们都和自然数之间存在一一映射，或者说和自然数一样多。我们把和自然数等势的无穷集合叫作可数无穷。是不是所有的无穷集合都是可数的呢？是否存在更大的无穷呢？1873年11月29日康托尔给戴徳金的一封信中提到了这个问题：“取所有的自然数集合，记为$N$，然后考虑所有实数的集合，记为$R$。简单来说，问题就是两者是否能够对应起来，使得一个集中的每一个体只对应另一集中一个唯一的个体？乍一看，我们可以说答案是否定的，这种对应不可能，因为前者由离散的部分组成，而后者则构成一个连续统。但从这种说法里我们什么也得不到。虽然我非常倾向认为这两者不能有这样的一个一一对应，但是我找不出理由，我对这事极为关注，也许这理由非常简单。”

\index{对角线证明}
一个星期后的12月7日，在写给戴徳金的信中，康托尔自己回答了这个问题，他发现实数集合不能和自然数集合构成一一对应。这一天可以看作是集合论的诞生日。康托尔曾经给出过两个证明，其中第二个证明最为脍炙人口，就是大名鼎鼎的“对角线证明”。

康托尔首先使用反证法，假设区间$(0, 1)$上的全部实数是可数的，可以和自然数一一对应。那么就可以把这个区间里的全部实数列出来，形成一个序列$a_0, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, ...$。现在将这个序列中的每个实数都表示成小数形式。如果是无理数，它的小数形式是无限不循环的；如果是除不尽的分数，则其小数形式是无限循环的，例如$\dfrac{1}{3} = 0.333...$；如果能够除尽，我们就在后面补无穷多个零，例如$\dfrac{1}{2} = 0.5000...$。于是实数区间$(0, 1]$中的所有实数可以排成下面的序列：

\[
\begin{array}{l}
a_0 = 0.a_{00}a_{01}a_{02}a_{03}...\\
a_1 = 0.a_{10}a_{11}a_{12}a_{13}...\\
a_2 = 0.a_{20}a_{21}a_{22}a_{23}...\\
a_3 = 0.a_{30}a_{31}a_{32}a_{33}...\\
... \\
a_n = 0.a_{n0}a_{n1}a_{n2}a_{n3}...\\
... \\
\end{array}
\]

有一点我要提醒一下读者：$a_0, a_1, a_2, ...$并不一定是按照大小次序排列的。现在构造一个数$b = 0.b_0b_1b_2b_3...b_n...$，使它的第$n$位数字$b_n \neq a_{nn}$。为了做到这一点，我们可以规定一个很简单的规则，例如若$a_{nn} \neq 5$，就让$b_n = 5$，否则就让$b_n = 6$，即：

\[
b_n = \begin{cases}
5 & : a_{nn} \neq 5 \\
6 & : a_{nn} = 5 \\
\end{cases}
\]

这样构造出来的数$b$一定不等于上述序列中的任何一个数。因为至少它们的第$n$位数字不相同。也就是对角线上的数字至少不同。我们把对角线上的数字写成黑体，这样就很明显了。

\[
\begin{array}{l}
a_0 = 0.\pmb{a_{00}}a_{01}a_{02}a_{03}...\\
a_1 = 0.a_{10}\pmb{a_{11}}a_{12}a_{13}...\\
a_2 = 0.a_{20}a_{21}\pmb{a_{22}}a_{23}...\\
a_3 = 0.a_{30}a_{31}a_{32}\pmb{a_{33}}...\\
... \\
a_n = 0.a_{n0}a_{n1}a_{n2}a_{n3}...\pmb{a_{nn}}...\\
... \\
\end{array}
\]

我们此前假设$(0, 1)$间的所有实数都被逐一列出了，无一遗漏。$b$显然属于这一区间，但它却不等于任何一个$a_i$。这说明我们假设的一一映射遗漏了$b$，导致了矛盾，所以假设不成立，我们无法把这一区间的所有实数和自然数之间构造一一映射。由于利用了对角线上的数字都不相等的这一事实，这一证法称作康托尔对角线证明。

有人说，把$b$加进$a_0, a_1, a_2, ...$中去不就可以了么？假设$b$加进去后，处于第$m$个位置，我们仍然可以再次构造一个新数$c$，只要让它的第$m$位不等于$b_m$就又出现了一个没有包含的数。

\index{不可数集}
这一证明简单、直观。它揭示了一个惊人的事实：$(0, 1)$间的实数集是不可数的！它是我们发现的第一个比自然数集更大的无穷集合\footnote{柯朗在《什么是数学》中给出了一个更为直观的几何证明。假设单位线段(0, 1)之间的点能排成可数的序列$a_1, a_2, a_3, ...$我们用一个长1/10的区间盖住$a_1$点，用长1/100的区间盖住$a_2$点……用长$1/10^n$的区间盖住$a_n$点，如此下去，则(0, 1)这一单位线段将完全被长为1/10, 1/100, 1/1000……的子区间（可能相互重叠）完全盖住。但这些子区间的长度总和为等比数列$1/10 + 1/100 + 1/1000 + ... = 1/9 < 1$，让总长度为1/9的区间覆盖长度为1的线段是不可能的。所以假设错误，线段上的点是不可数的\cite{Courant1969}。}。接下来，我们构造一个一一映射：$y = \pi x - \dfrac{\pi}{2}$。它把区间$(0, 1)$中的每个实数，映射到区间$(-\dfrac{\pi}{2}, \dfrac{\pi}{2})$中，无一遗漏。因此我们立即得知这一区间内的实数集是不可数的。接下来，我们压上最后一根稻草。再构造一个一一映射：$ y = tan(x)$。它把区间$-\dfrac{\pi}{2}$到$\dfrac{\pi}{2}$中的每一个实数，无一遗漏地映射到了全体实数集上\footnote{还有一种几何方法可以将单位线段一一映射到全体实数上。我们将单位线段弄弯成为长度为1的半圆弧，然后在圆外画一条无限长的直线L。现在从圆心到L上任意一点P的连线必然与圆弧相交于一点Q。这样就形成了一一映射。}。康托尔得到了他的重要结论：实数集不再是可数集，它是比可数集更高等级的无穷。康托尔称之为不可数集，记作$C$。

这自然让人联想到线段上的点。在欧几里得的《几何原本》中，点被定义为没有大小的部分，而直线被认为由点组成。根据希帕索斯的发现，我们知道直线上存在无理数。或者说有理数不能够填充直线。而实数是可以填充线段的。我们在下一节中，还会介绍戴徳金分割，从而给出实数的严密化定义。上面的证明告诉我们，单位长度线段上的点，和任何长度线段上的点，以及无限长的直线上的点，也就是数轴上稠密的点是一样多的。都是不可数集。同心圆上的点也是同样多的，它们也都是不可数集。

同样令人吃惊的是无理数与有理数多少的比较。直观上思考，任何两个有理数之间，存在着无穷多的无理数；任何两个无理数之间，也存在着无穷多的有理数，我们会觉得无理数和有理数应该一样多。然而康托尔的结论告诉我们，有理数是可数的，而无理数是不可数的。这说明无理数远远多于有理数。再进一步，我们前面证明了代数数是可数的，这说明像$\pi, e$这样的超越数是不可数的，它们要远远多于代数数。

在希尔伯特无穷旅馆第三天的故事中，我们发现一维的可数无穷可以和二维的无穷多格子点对应起来。并以此为基础证明了有理数是可数无穷。但是一维线段上代表实数的点和二维平面上的点谁多谁少？还是同样多呢？1874年1月，康托尔在写给戴徳金的信中提出了这个问题。他几乎肯定的觉得，二维正方形比一维的线段包含更多的点。但是却没能给出证明。时光匆匆过了四年之后，康托尔惊奇地发现，他此前结论是错误的，并且找到了一个有趣的一一对应。1877年6月他写信给戴徳金，请审查他的证明。在信中，康托尔说出了本章开头那句著名的话：“我看到了，但我不相信。”

我们接下来看看这个一一对应是如何展示“一沙一世界”的奇观的。我们面对的两个无穷点集一个是单位正方形

\[
E = \{ (x, y) | 0 < x < 1, 0 < y < 1\}
\]

另一个是单位线段$(0, 1)$。取单位正方形内的任意一个点$(x, y)$，然后把$x$和$y$都表示成无穷小数（如果是有限小数，比如0.5，就写成0.4999...，请参考本节习题）。现在把$x, y$的小数部分分成一组一组的，每组都终止在第一个非0数字上。例如：

\[
\begin{array}{lcccccc}
x = 0.3 & 02 & 4 & 005 & 6 & ... \\
y = 0.01 & 7 & 06 & 8 & 04 & ... \\
\end{array}
\]

然后我们构造一个数字$ z = 0.3\ 01\ 02\ 7\ 4\ 06\ 005\ 8\ 6\ 04\ ...$。这个构造过程交错地从$x$和$y$的各组中取数字，无一遗漏。也就是先写下0和小数点，然后取$x$的第一组，也就是3，然后取$y$第一组，也就是数字01，然后取$x$的第二组02，接下来取$y$的第二组7……，$z$显然在单位线段内。对于单位正方形内不同的点，其小数表示$x$或$y$上必有不同的数字。因此对应的$z$也是不同的。这说明$(x, y) \mapsto z$是单射。反过来，对于单位线段上任意点$z$，我们也可以把$z$的无穷小数形式像上面那样分组，然后把奇数组取出放在0和小数点后构成$x$，把偶数组取出构成$y$。则$(x, y)$是单位正方形内的点。这说明$(x, y) \mapsto z$是满射。因而这个映射是一一映射。于是我们证明了单位长度线段内的点和二维平面上的点具有相同的基数，它们同样多，都是不可数无穷。

仿照此方法，我们接下来可以证明不仅线段和平面上的点同样多，它和三维空间中的点也同样多。甚至一般的$n$维空间中的点也和线段上的点同样多。

在康托尔以前，尽管有争议，但是人们只能区分出有限和无穷。没有人想过无穷之中还有区别。康托尔第一个向我们揭示，无穷也是可以分类的。存在着可数无穷和不可数无穷。康托尔并没有止步，接下来的问题是：存在比不可数无穷更大的无穷么？我们在寻找无穷等级的道路上走到终点了么？在展示进一步的结论前，我们先了解一下戴徳金关于实数别出心裁的定义。

\begin{Exercise}
\Question{令$x = 0.9999....$, 则$10x = 9.9999...$，做减法得$10x - x = 9$，解方程得$x = 1$。因此得到结论$1 = 0.9999...$。这一证明正确么？}
\end{Exercise}

\subsection{戴得金分割}
\index{戴徳金分割}
为了解决微积分基础的严密性问题，十九世纪的数学家们开始重新思考牛顿、莱布尼茨、雅可比、欧拉使用的一些令人困惑的概念。包括无穷小量和级数等等。经过柯西和魏尔斯特拉斯等人的工作，终于给出了严格的极限，收敛等概念。但有一个本质问题始终未得到圆满的解决。那就是实数的概念。微积分是建立在实数连续性上的。可人们仍然没有一个关于实数满意的定义。最早人们把有理数比作直线，结果发现有理数间充满了间隙，它是不完备、不连续的。而我们则把直线看作没有间隙的、完备的和连续的。直线的连续性究竟是什么意思？人们迫切需要连续性的一个精确定义。

戴徳金经过多年的思考，终于在1872年想出了一个方法——即著名的戴徳金分割。戴徳金指出，有理数具有稠密性，即任意两个有理数间，不管多么靠近，总存在着另外的有理数。但是有理数却不连续。连续的直线究竟意味着什么呢？此时让我们想象一把最锋利的“思想之刀”，在天衣无缝的直线上切下去，将它分割成两截（\cite{HanXueTao16}，第196页）。

由于直线是连续的，天衣无缝的，不管多么锋利，这一刀一定落在某一点上，而不是在两点的缝隙间。（如果是有理数而非实数，这一刀可能落在某个有理数代表的点上，也可能落在两个有理数之间，比如恰好落在$\sqrt{2}$代表的位置上。）假定从点$A$的位置上把直线切开，则$A$不在左边，就在右边。二者必居其一，不会两边都有，也不会两边都没有。这是因为点不可分割、也不会消失掉。换言之，直线的连续性意味着，不管从何处将直线切成两段，总是有一段是带有端点的，而另一段没有端点。

由此，戴徳金定义了这样的一个分割$(A_1, A_2)$，$A_1$和$A_2$分别叫作下类和上类。其中下类$A_1$中的每个数都小于上类$A_2$中的任意一个数。也就是说$A_1$对应分割的左半段直线，而$A_2$对应着右半段直线。对于这样的分割，要么$A_1$中存在着一个最大数，要么$A_2$中存在着一个最小数。二者必居其一，且仅居其一。

\begin{figure}[htbp]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{img/Dedekind-cut.eps}
 %\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
 \caption{用戴徳金分割构造的$\sqrt{2}$}
 \label{fig:Dedekind-cut}
\end{figure}

用戴徳金分割来分析全体有理数，会发现有理数是不连续的。如果$A_1$包含了所有小于等于2的有理数，$A_2$包含了所有大于2的有理数，这一分割就定义了有理数2。但是考虑这样一个反例：下类$A_1$包含所有负有理数，以及非负的，但平方小于2的有理数；上类$A_2$包含剩余的有理数。不难发现在这一分割中，下类没有最大数，同时上类没有最小数。这说明有理数间存在着缝隙，从这里砍下去，这一刀就会落空。这个划分实际上确定了一个新数$\sqrt{2}$，但它不是有理数。如图\ref{fig:Dedekind-cut}所示。

于是戴徳金得到了他的结论：有理数的每一个分割就叫作一个实数。带缝隙的分割（$A_1$没有最大数，$A_2$没有最小数）叫作无理数；不带缝隙的分割（$A_1$存在最大数，或$A_2$存在最小数）叫作有理数。而实数正好包含有理数和无理数。由此戴徳金分割定义了实数，直线上的每个点可以表示一个实数。戴徳金的分割概念也给出了实数连续性的依据。

从毕达哥拉斯学派的希帕索斯发现无理数到戴徳金最终给出实数的定义，时光经历了两千多年\footnote{同一年，魏尔斯特拉斯通过有界单调序列理论，康托尔通过有理数序列理论也都从有理数出发定义出无理数，从而构筑起了实数理论。可谓殊途同归。}。在戴徳金分割中，总是把数分成两个完成了的无穷整体，即无穷集合。这是对实无穷概念的运用和发展。

\subsection{超限数和连续统假设}
\index{幂集}
为了寻找更大的无穷，康托尔首先考虑了幂集。所谓幂集，就是一个集合的所有子集构成的集合。例如集合$A = \{a, b\}$，则它的幂集包含$\{\phi, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{a, b\}\}$一共四个元素。而有3个元素集合的幂集包含8个子集。一个集合中每个元素都可以被选中或者跳过以构造子集，这样具有$n$个元素的集合的幂集大小为$2^n$。显然有限集的幂集元素个数大于原集合。

\index{康托尔定理}
康托尔在1891年证明了，当推广到无限集时，这一结论也成立。所以幂集的基数总是大于原集合的基数。这一定理现在被人们称作\textbf{康托尔定理}。这一证明并不困难。读者可以参考本章的附录，了解其详细过程。有了这一定理后，就打开了寻找更大的无穷的通路了。康托尔把自然数集等可数无穷的基数称作阿列夫零，记为$\aleph_0$，阿列夫是希伯来文字母表的第一个字母。可数无穷的幂集基数记作$2^{\aleph_0}$，并且由康托尔定理有$\aleph_0 < 2^{\aleph_0}$，并且我们还可以通过幂集的幂集不断产生更大的无穷。

\be
\aleph_0, 2^{\aleph_0}, 2^{2^{\aleph_0}}, ...
\ee

\subsubsection{超限数}
\index{超限数}
康托尔把存在等级的无穷基数序列叫作超限基数。所以希尔伯特神奇旅馆中揭示的超限数计算法则就是$\aleph_0 + 1 = \aleph_0$, $\aleph_0 + k = \aleph_0 $, $\aleph_0 + \aleph_0 = \aleph_0$, ...

\index{序数}
除了用幂集来产生更高等级的无穷外，康托尔还发现了另外一种方法。为此，我们需要引入序数的归纳定义：

\begin{enumerate}
\item 0是序数；
\item 如果$a$是序数，则$a \cup \{a\}$是序数，记作$a + 1$，称作$a$的后继；
\item 如果$S$是序数的集合，也就是$S$的元素都是序数，则$\cup S$是序数；
\item 任何序数，都是通过上述1到3步获得的。
\end{enumerate}

根据这个定义，从0开始的前几个序数如下：

\[
\begin{array}{l}
0 \\
1 = 0 \cup \{0\} \\
2 = 1 \cup \{1\} = 0 \cup \{0\} \cup \{0 \cup \{0\}\} \\
3 = 2 \cup \{2\} = 1 \cup \{1\} \cup \{1 \cup \{1\}\} = ... \\
... \\
\end{array}
\]

这里$\cup S$称为集合$S$的广义并。它是由$S$的所有元素的元素组成的集合。根据序数定义的前两条，我们发现自然数0, 1, 2, 3, ..., n, ... 都是序数。令$\omega$是自然数集合，由于自然数都是序数，所以$\omega$也是一个序数的集合。我们考虑它的广义并：

\[
\cup \omega = \{0, 1, 2, ...\} = \omega
\]

根据序数的第三条定义，说明$\omega$也是一个序数，它是一个极限序数，并且是最小的无穷序数。我们把它添加到自然数的末尾就得到了一个新序列：

\[
0, 1, 2, ..., \omega
\]

从$\omega$开始，再次重复使用序数的第二条定义，又可以得到序数列：

\[
\omega + 1, \omega + 2, \omega + 3, ..., \omega + n, ...
\]

将上面两个序列合并到一起组成一个集合，记作$\omega \cdot 2$。不难发现其广义并$\cup \omega \cdot 2 = \omega \cdot 2$。所以$\omega \cdot 2$也是一个序数，并且是极限序数。从$\omega \cdot 2$开始，继续重复上述过程，我们就得到了无限伸展的无穷序数列：

\be
\begin{array}{l}
0, 1, 2, ..., n, ... \\
\omega, \omega + 1, \omega + 2, ..., \omega + n, ... \\
\omega \cdot 2, \omega \cdot 2 + 1, \omega \cdot 2 + 2, ..., \omega \cdot 2 + n, ... \\
...\\
\omega \cdot k, \omega \cdot k + 1, \omega \cdot k + 2, ..., \omega \cdot k + n, ... \\
... \\
\omega^2, \omega^2 + 1, \omega^2 + 2, ..., \omega^2 + n, ... \\
...\\
\omega^3, \omega^3 + 1, \omega^3 + 2, ..., \omega^3 + n, ... \\
...\\
\omega^\omega, \omega^\omega + 1, \omega^\omega + 2, ..., \omega^\omega + n, ... \\
...\\
\end{array}
\label{eq:countable-ordinal-nums}
\ee

除了第一行是自然数外，其它都是无穷序数，并且每行的第一个是极限序数。用这种方式得到的序数，已经远远超出人们所能想象的范围，把自然数扩展成一个无穷无尽的序数王国。但是，可以证明，这些序数都是可数序数，作为集合，竟然能够与自然数集构成一一对应。我们即将看到，还存在着不可数序数，甚至存在着一个比一个更大的无穷序数列。

我们列出的这些序数中，如果挑选一个作为可数集合的基数，用哪一个最好呢？自然会想到最小的一个极限序数$\omega$。于是这引出了基数的一般定义：

\index{基数}
\begin{definition}
设$a$是一个序数，如果对于任一序数$b$，当$b < a$时，有$b$的势小于$a$的势，则称序数$a$为基数。
\end{definition}

有这个定义，我们立即得出结论：所有自然数$n$都是基数，并且$\omega$是基数。序数$\omega$当作基数使用时，记作$\aleph_0$。即$\aleph_0 = \omega$，前面我们已经用$\aleph_0$表示可数集合的基数。

除了$\omega$外，序列(\ref{eq:countable-ordinal-nums})中其余的无穷序数都比$\omega$大，但其势却与$\omega$的势相等（都等于可数无穷）。所以根据定义，它们都不是基数。

为了获取更大的基数，为此我们将此前序列(\ref{eq:countable-ordinal-nums})中的所有序数汇集在一起组成一个集合，记作$\omega_1$。

\[
\omega_1 = \{ a | a \text{是序数，且} |a| \leq \aleph_0\}
\]

其中$|a|$表示$a$的势\footnote{严格来说，$A$的势应使用符号$\overline{\overline{A}}$，或$\#A, card(A), n(A)$。}。可以证明$\omega_1$是序数，并且是第一个不可数序数。然后我们仿照前面的方法，从$\omega_1$之后扩展无穷序数列：

\[
\omega_1, \omega_1 + 1, ..., \omega_1 \cdot 2, ..., \omega_1^2, ..., \omega_1^\omega, ...
\]

这里枚举的无穷序列都是等势的，其中最小的一个是$\omega_1$，它还满足基数的条件，这样我们就得到了第二个无穷基数$\aleph_1 = \omega_1$。仿照$\omega_1$的构造过程，我们可以再构造一个集合：

\[
\omega_2 = \{ a | a \text{是序数，且} |a| \leq \aleph_1\}
\]

这样就获得了第三个无穷基数$\aleph_2 = \omega_2$。继续进行下去，我们可以得到一系列无穷基数。概括来说，对任一序数$a$，当定义了无穷基数$\aleph_a$之后，我们可以再次构造集合：

\[
\omega_{a+1} = \{ b | b \text{是序数，且} |b| \leq \aleph_a\}
\]

由此得到比$\aleph_a$大的无穷基数$\aleph_{a+1} = \omega_{a+1}$。总之对于任一序数$a$，相应都有一个无穷基数$\aleph_a$，由此得到无穷基数组成的无穷序列：

\be
\aleph_0, \aleph_1, \aleph_2, ..., \aleph_n, ..., \aleph_{\omega}, ...
\ee

它们是从小到大排列的，并且相邻的两个阿列夫之间不再有其它的无穷基数。无穷序数和无穷基数也称为超限序数和超限基数，统称为超限数。这些越来越巨大的超限数最终归于何处呢？康托尔认为那将是上帝。

超限数一经面试，立即引发了激烈的反应。有人赞叹这是康托尔惊人的创举，开辟了前所未见的新视野。也有人认为超限数是“雾上之雾”，康托尔正在创造病态的数学。尽管存在巨大的争议，超限数是十九世纪最惊人的思想成就之一。

\subsubsection{连续统假设}
\index{连续统假设} \index{CH} \index{GCH}
康托尔发现了两种无穷基数序列，一个是幂集，另一个是超限基数：

\[
\aleph_0, 2^{\aleph_0}, 2^{2^{\aleph_0}}, ...
\]

和

\[
\aleph_0, \aleph_1, \aleph_2, ...
\]

根据上面的分析，我们知道$\aleph_1$是紧跟着可数无穷基数$\aleph_0$之后的下一个超限基数。然而根据幂集的性质，我们只知道$2^{\aleph_0}$比可数无穷基数$\aleph_0$大。但我们不知道它和$\aleph_1$的大小关系。康托尔猜测$2^{\aleph_0} = \aleph_1$，也就是在$\aleph_0$和$2^{\aleph_0}$之间不存在其它无限基数。$2^{\aleph_0}$是第一个比可数集大的超限基数。

康托尔在1847年证明了$2^{\aleph_0} = C$，也就是说，自然数的所有子集所具有的元素数正好等于实数集的元素数。因此康托尔的猜测等价于说在可数集$\aleph_0$与不可数集$C$之间不存在其它无限基数。由于通常称实数集为连续统，因此这一猜想被称为连续统假设，英文为：Continuum Hypothesis，简记为CH。

连续统假设还可以进一步推广。即考虑对于任一序数$a$，$2^{\aleph_a} = \aleph_{a+1}$是否成立。这一假设被称为广义连续统假设，简记为GCH。

康托尔在1878年的一篇论文提出了连续统假设。他一开始对证明这一猜想是比较乐观的。据说康托尔曾经说他已经成功解决了这一难题，并即将公布他的证明。但直到他1918年去世，也没有把证明公之于众。大概是发现了证明中的问题而未公开发表。康托尔晚年为此投入了大量的精力，但是长时间未能突破连续统假设，加之其它原因最终导致他陷入了抑郁，并在哈雷大学的精神病院中逝世。

1900年夏天，著名的数学家希尔伯特在巴黎召开的第二届国际数学家大会上，作了题为《数学问题》的演说。提出了23个未解决的问题，向二十世纪的数学家提出挑战。其中第一个问题就是“证明连续统假设”。可见他对这一问题的重视。

连续统问题是数学来源于几何、力学、和物理等方面现实问题的一个范例。希尔伯特认为，连续统问题来自外部世界，纯数学需要从外部世界汲取新材料，外部世界是数学的源泉。正因为连续统问题是数学中一个最基本的问题，或者说它是数学基础的问题，长期以来一直是数理逻辑和公理集合论的一个中心问题。一百多年来，虽然经过许多著名数学家的精心钻研。取得了一些重大进展，但还没有完全解决。1938年哥德尔证明了，从公理集合论的ZFC系统（策梅罗——弗兰克尔系统加上选择公理的简称，选择公理是说我们能从任一集合，包括无穷集合中选出若干元素。我们将在下一章详细介绍）推不出CH的否定。即连续统假设与ZFC系统是相容的。在哥德尔的结果之后，人们希望能够从ZF系统（ZF系统是不带有选择公理的集合论系统）内证明连续统假设。

1963年7月，美国的年轻数学家科恩创造了威力极大的力破法，解决了相反的问题，他证明了从ZFC推不出CH。这就说明了连续统假设和ZFC系统是相对独立的。有一则插曲说，科恩完成了证明后，并不能确信自己的证明（\cite{HanXueTao16}，第280页）。他来到普林斯顿敲响了哥德尔的家门。当时的哥德尔正在同妄想症斗争，他仅仅打来了一条门缝，让科恩把证明塞进去。科恩则被关在了门外。两天后，哥德尔邀请科恩进屋喝茶，大师终于认可了他的证明。

综合哥德尔和科恩的结果，也就是说连续统假设在ZFC系统中是不可判定的。我们在下一章会深入介绍不可判定性。连续统假设与ZF系统的公理无关。类似的结论还发生在集合论中的选择公里上。哥德尔和科恩的结论同时也说明，选择公理在ZF系统中是不可判定的。这说明在ZF公理集合论系统中，承认选择公理可以得到一种数学；否定选择公理可以得到另一种数学。两者都是无矛盾的。同样，加上选择公理后，承认或者否定连续统假设也都可以各自发展出无矛盾的数学。这就是100多年来人们在选择公理与连续统假设的研究中获得的主要成果\cite{GCH}。

伴随着对无穷的思考与探索，也不断催生了关于无穷的艺术创作。人们仰视浩瀚苍穹，远眺无垠的大海，感叹自然的神秘和伟大。

在无数描绘广袤天空的作品中，荷兰后印象派艺术大师梵·高创作的《星空》可谓让人印象深刻。在这幅画中，梵高用夸张的手法，生动地描绘了充满运动和变化的星空。 整个画面被一股汹涌、动荡的蓝绿色激流所吞噬，旋转、躁动、卷曲的星云使夜空变得异常活跃，脱离现实的景象反映出梵·高躁动不安的情感和疯狂的幻觉世界。这幅画创作于1889年，当时梵·高正在阿尔勒圣雷米的一家精神病院治疗，在那驻留了108天。在入住精神病院期间，梵高创作了大量的绘画作品，共计一百五十多幅油画和一百多幅素描。而作品《星空》所描述的风景也正是精神病院所在地圣雷米。

英国画家透纳，在创作《暴风雪：汽船驶离港口》时，为了充分体验大海无边的威力，他让水手把自己捆在船桅上。他后来写道：“为了观察大海，我让水手们把我捆在船桅上。我那样过了四个小时，没指望能活下来。”然而，评论家们却对这幅画表示失望和怀疑，因为在这幅画中，形体和戏剧性的场面都消失了。透纳解释说，他画这幅画是为了告诉自己和别人，在惊涛骇浪的海上，暴风雪是什么样子。虽然描画的是在漩涡风暴中航行的船，但是所呈现的却是船只与风暴融为一体的画面。透纳大胆地以抽象手法表现船的形式，自由运用色彩，成功的表现出“风暴的气氛”。透纳因此被称为印象派的先驱。

对无穷的思考很快脱离了自然界中的具体事物，而上升到哲学和宗教。在托勒密的宇宙模型中，行星是嵌套在一起的同心球，最外层存在一个有界的恒星天球。到了中世纪，基督教在很大程度上吸收了亚里士多德和托勒密的学说，认为上帝创造的地球是宇宙的中心，而恒星天球是有界的。

%% Camille Flammarion, L'Atmosphere: Météorologie Populaire (Paris, 1888), p. 163.

%% The Flammarion Woodcut is an enigmatic woodcut by an unknown artist. It is referred to as the Flammarion Woodcut because its first documented appearance is in page 163 of Camille Flammarion's L'atmosphère: météorologie populaire (Paris, 1888), a work on meteorology for a general audience. The woodcut depicts a man peering through the Earth's atmosphere as if it were a curtain to look at the inner workings of the universe.

%% The original caption bellow the picture translated to: "A medieval missionary (Bruno) tells that he has found the point where heaven and Earth meet...".

1888年在巴黎出版的一幅木刻版画反映了当时人们对于有穷世界边沿的思考。一个人如果站在天球的边沿，是否可以伸出自己的手臂或者举起一根手杖？如果不可以，这显然是难以理解的，如果可以，那么处于物质世界外围的空间是什么？这就是宇宙边缘悖论。为了解决这个难题，中世纪的基督教重塑了亚里士多德的学说，提出了一种渐进边缘理论。还有人为，如果在宇宙的边缘向外抛出一支矛，就会推动宇宙扩大。物质世界是有界的，但界被无尽的虚空包围。

文艺复兴时期，数学逐渐被当时艺术大师们引入到作品中。达芬奇不仅深谙解刨和透视，还有意识地在在作品中使用引发美感的比例。这一时期的德国画家丢勒仔细研究了人体的各种比例，甚至利用坐标格点来描述透视的关系。丢勒的《量度四书》既介绍了绘画理论，也对几何原理和透视原理进行了研究。随后开普勒和笛沙格独立发展出了摄影几何中的无穷远点概念。笛沙格概括消失点的用途，纳入无穷远时的情形，发展出建构透视图的另一种方法。他让平行线确实平行的欧氏几何成为所有可能的几何系统都会有的特例。

\index{非欧几何}
真正从本质上改变了艺术家的视角，使得人们能够直接表现无穷要从非欧几何的诞生说起。长期以来，欧几里得几何被人们认为是完美的公理系统和演绎推理的典范。但是追求尽善尽美的数学家对于欧几里得第五公设颇有微词。前几条公设简单直观，符合直觉，例如说两点之间能够画一条直线，所有直角都相等。而第五公设描述却比较复杂。它说如果某条直线与两直线相交，且同侧两个内角和小于两个直角，那么两条直线无限延长后就会在该侧相交。第五公设也叫作平行公设，它等价于说，在平面内过直线外一点有且仅有一条平行线。人们感觉第五公设能从前面四条公设里推导出，并且实际上欧几里得在《几何原本》前面相当大的部分也都没有使用第五公设。在其后的两千多年里，很多人试图证明第五公设，但都失败了。于是意大利数学家撒凯里（Saccheri）尝试用反证法来证明，他假定第五公设不成立，然后导出一整套几何系统和奇怪的结论，接下来他宣称这些结果太过荒谬，从而说明第五公设是必定是正确的。

19世纪，德国数学家高斯、俄国数学家罗巴切夫斯基、匈牙利数学家波尔约等人各自独立地认识到这种证明是不可能的。也就是说，平行公理是独立于其他公理的，并且可以用不同的“平行公理”来替代它。高斯关于非欧几何的信件和笔记在他生前一直没有公开发表，只是在他1885年去世后出版时才引起人们的注意。罗巴切夫斯基和波尔约分别在1830年前后发表了他们关于非欧几何的理论。在这种几何里，罗巴切夫斯基平行公理替代了欧几里得平行公理，即在一个平面上，过已知直线外一点至少有两条直线与该直线不相交。由此可演绎出一系列全无矛盾的结论，并且可以得出三角形的内角和小于两直角。罗氏几何中有许多不同于欧氏几何的定理。

继罗氏几何后，德国数学家黎曼在1854年又提出了既不是欧氏几何也不是罗氏几何的新的非欧几何。这种几何采用如下公理替代欧几里得平行公理：同一平面上的任何两直线一定相交。同时，还对欧氏几何的其他公理做了部分改动。在这种几何里，三角形的内角和大于两直角。人们把这种几何称为椭圆几何。

直到1866年，意大利数学家贝尔特拉米在他出版的《非欧几何解释的尝试》中，证明了非欧平面几何可以局部地在欧氏空间中实现。1871年，德国数学家克莱因认识到从射影几何中可以推导度量几何，并建立了非欧几何模型。这样，非欧几何的相容性问题就归结为欧氏几何的相容性问题，由此非欧几何得到了普遍的承认。

非欧几何向我们揭示这样一种可能性，即无穷的空间可能是有界的。法国数学家庞加莱在他的科普读物《科学与假设》中介绍了这样一种有趣的世界。整个世界被一个大小有限的球包围起来。中心的温度很高，随着远离中心，温度成比例地减小。当接近包围这这个世界的球面时，温度降到绝对零度。如果大球的半径是$R$，某点到球心的距离是$r$，则温度与$R^2 - r^2$成比例。这个世界中，由于热胀冷缩，物体的大小和温度成比例，越接近世界的边沿，物体越小。于是就出现这样的一个奇观，当这个世界的居民接近球面时，温度越来越低，他们越来越小，步伐也越来越小，他们永远也到不了世界的边沿，尽管这个世界是有限的。庞加莱描述的这个世界，实际上起作用的几何是一种称为双曲几何的非欧几里得几何学。

荷兰画家埃舍尔受到庞加莱的启发，创作了多个艺术作品来描述这种有限但无穷的世界。这一系列作品被命名为圆极限系列。不管是天使、魔鬼、还是游动的鱼，都在接近圆盘的边缘时变小，从而永远无法到达这个有界但无穷的边沿。

不仅是艺术，在音乐中也有对无穷的思索和表现。1747年5月，巴赫访问了波茨坦宫廷圣苏西宫。巴赫到了圣苏西宫后，腓特烈大帝向他展示了刚刚引进的吉尔博曼钢琴。宫廷音乐会上腓特烈大帝给了巴赫一个音乐主题，老巴赫当场即兴对其进行了一个三声部的赋格变奏。这是事前毫无演练的即兴演奏。这不仅使大帝十分满意，在场众人也无不瞠目结舌。巴赫本人觉得这首曲子的主题非常美丽，于是打算将来写成一首赋格曲，以供出版。回到莱比锡后，巴赫重新对国王主题进行变奏创作，将整个曲子按两首赋格曲，四乐章三重奏鸣曲和十首卡农的构成完成了整个曲子。巴赫在献词上所署名的时间正好是7月7日。这就是巴赫的经典名作《音乐的奉献》，乐曲编号BWV1079。在其中有一首极不寻常的卡农，只标着“Canon per Tonos”这三个词。翻译过来的意思是经由种种调性的卡农。后人称之为“无穷升高的卡农”。侯世达在《哥德尔、埃舍尔、巴赫——集异璧之大成》一书中写到：

\end{figure}

它有三个声部，最高声部是国王主题的一个变奏，下面两个声部则提供了一个建立在第二主题之上的卡农化的和声。这两个声部中较低的那个声部用C小调奏出主题，而较高的那个则在差五度之上奏出同一主题。特殊之处在于，当它结束时——或者不如说似乎要结束时——已不再是C小调而是D小调了。巴赫在听众的鼻子底下转了调。而且这一结构使得这一“结尾”很通顺地与开头联接起来。这样可以重复这一过程并在E调上回到开头。这些连续的变调带着听众不断上升到越来越远的调区，因此听了几段之后，听众会以为他要无休止地远离开始的调子了。然而在整整六次这样的变调之后，原来的C小调又魔术般地恢复了！所有的声音都恰好比原来高八度。在这里整部曲子可以以符合音乐规则的方式终止。人们猜想，这里就是巴赫的意图。但巴赫很明确地留下了一个暗示，说这一过程可以无休止地进行下去。也许这就是为什么他在边上写下了“转调升高，国王的荣耀也升高。”\cite{GEB}

\section{附录：康托尔定理的证明}

\begin{theorem}
\textbf{康托尔定理}：对于任意集合都有$|S| < |2^S|$，其中$|S|$表示集合$S$的势，$2^S$表示$S$的幂集，即$S$的所有子集组成的集合。
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
我们分两步证明。首先证明$|S| \leq |2^S|$。对于任一$x$，令$f(x) = \{x\}$，也就是仅含有$x$唯一元素的集合。对于不同的元素$x_1 \neq x_2$，自然有$\{x_1\} \neq \{x_2\}$，即$f(x_1) \neq f(x_2)$。从而映射$S \arrowto{f} 2^S$是一单射。因此有
\[
  |S| \leq |2^S|
\]

第二步，我们证明$|S| \neq |2^S|$。采用反证法，假设等号成立。则存在一一映射$S \arrowto{\phi} 2^S$，使得对任一$x \in S$，都有$\phi(x) \in 2^S$。即$\phi(x)$是$S$的某个子集，所以$\phi(x) \subseteq S$。现在要问：$x$是否属于$\phi(x)$？有两种可能：一种是$x \in \phi(x)$，也可能是$x \notin \phi(x)$。我们把所有$x$不属于$\phi(x)$的元素放在一起构造一个新集合$S_0$：

\be
S_0 = \{ x | x \in S, \text{并且} x \notin \phi(x)\}
\label{eq:def-s0}
\ee

显然$S_0$是$S$的子集，即$S_0 \subseteq S$，因此$S_0 \in 2^S$。由于$\phi$是一一映射，所以必然存在一个$x_0$，使得$\phi(x_0) = S_0$。根据逻辑中的排中律，要么$x_0 \in S_0$，要么$x_0 \notin S_0$，二者必居其一，且仅有一个成立。

接下来分情况讨论。如果$x_0 \in S_0$成立，根据式(\ref{eq:def-s0})中$S_0$的定义，应该有$x_0 \notin \phi(x_0)$，由于$\phi(x_0) = S_0$，所以$x_0 \notin S_0$。

如果$x_0 \notin S_0$，因为$S_0 = \phi(x_0)$，所以得到$x_0 \notin \phi(x_0)$。这样根据$S_0$的定义(\ref{eq:def-s0})，又应该有$x_0 \in S_0$。

这样不论$x_0$是否属于$S_0$，都导致矛盾。这说明我们最初的假设$S$到$2^S$间存在一一映射是错误的。所以不等式$|S| \neq |2^S|$成立。

由这两步的结果：$|S| \leq |2^S|$，并且$|S| \neq |2^S|$，我们得到了康托尔定理的结论：

\[
  |S| < |2^S|
\]
\end{proof}

证明的第二部分，不由让我们联想起了著名的罗素悖论：令$S$为所有不属于自己的集合构成的集合，问$S$是否属于自己？我们将在下一章讲述罗素悖论和哥德尔不完全性定理。
